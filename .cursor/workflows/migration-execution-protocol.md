description: MANDATORY Docker-first protocol for all database migrations. No exceptions. No shortcuts.

# 🚨 MIGRATION EXECUTION PROTOCOL — DOCKER-FIRST (NON-NEGOTIABLE) 🚨

## WHY THIS EXISTS

A previous agent (SOOP) wrote a catastrophic destructive migration that passed INSPECTOR review.
The USER caught it moments before execution. The downstream effects would have destroyed live
clinical data, patient records, and the business.

**SOOP has been removed. Docker has been installed. This protocol is permanent.**

---

## THE RULE — NO EXCEPTIONS

```
WRITE → TEST IN DOCKER → INSPECTOR REVIEWS DOCKER RESULT → USER APPROVES → PROMOTE TO CLOUD
```

No migration file may be run against the **live Supabase cloud database** until it has been:
1. ✅ Run successfully against the **local Docker Supabase instance**
2. ✅ Verified by INSPECTOR (grep-based, not trust-based)
3. ✅ Explicitly approved by USER with the words "approved for cloud"

**Bypassing Docker = automatic FAIL. INSPECTOR must reject any ticket that skips this gate.**

---

## STEP-BY-STEP PROTOCOL

### Phase 1 — Write
- Agent writes SQL migration file to `migrations/NNN_description.sql`
- All statements must be: `IF NOT EXISTS`, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS`
- No DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN, RENAME, ALTER TYPE, TRUNCATE, DELETE FROM
- INSPECTOR validates file statically (grep checks) before any execution

### Phase 2 — Docker Test (USER executes)

**Start Docker Desktop first:**
1. Open Docker.app from Applications
2. Wait for whale icon in menu bar to stop animating

**Start local Supabase:**
```bash
supabase start
```
Wait for: `Started supabase local development setup.`

**Run the migration against local DB:**
```bash
supabase db execute --file migrations/NNN_description.sql
```
Or open the local Studio at http://localhost:54323 → SQL Editor → paste and run.

**Verify locally:**
```sql
-- Example verification after table creation:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'table_name';
```

### Phase 3 — INSPECTOR Review

INSPECTOR must confirm:
- [ ] Migration ran without errors in Docker (USER confirms)
- [ ] Verification query returned expected results
- [ ] No destructive operations exist in the file
- [ ] RLS is enabled on all new tables

### Phase 4 — Cloud Promotion (USER executes manually)

Only after INSPECTOR issues written approval:
1. Go to supabase.com/dashboard → project → SQL Editor
2. Paste migration file contents
3. Run
4. Paste result back for INSPECTOR confirmation

## AGENTS — MANDATORY READING

- ❌ NEVER tell the USER to skip Docker and run directly on cloud
- ❌ NEVER suggest Docker is "optional" or "adds complexity without benefit"
- ❌ NEVER execute SQL yourself — your job ends at writing the file
- ✅ Always wait for USER confirmation that Docker test passed before issuing PASS
- ✅ If Docker is not running, help the USER start it — do not route around it

## DOCKER QUICK REFERENCE

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `supabase start` | Start local Supabase (requires Docker running) |
| `supabase stop` | Stop local Supabase |
| `supabase status` | Check if local Supabase is running + get connection URLs |
| `supabase db execute --file migrations/NNN.sql` | Run a migration file locally |
| `supabase db reset` | ⚠️ DANGEROUS — resets local DB only, never cloud |

Local Studio URL: **http://localhost:54323**
Local DB port: **54322**
Local API port: **54321**
