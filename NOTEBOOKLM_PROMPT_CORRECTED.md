### **For Q&A Prep:**

```
I'm meeting with clinical leaders to discuss PPN Portal (Psychedelic Practitioner Network Research).

Prepare answers to these objections, using EXECUTIVE_PITCH_DECK.md and WHY_NO_PHI_EXECUTIVE_MEMO.md:

1. "Why not just use Osmind or another EHR?"
2. "How do you ensure data privacy without PHI?"
3. "What if law enforcement subpoenas your data?"
4. "How do you benchmark without patient identifiers?"
5. "What's your competitive moat?"

For each answer:
- Use correct name: "PPN Portal" or "Psychedelic Practitioner Network Research"
- Reference "No PHI, No Seizure Risk" messaging
- Explain network benchmarking advantage
- Tone: Professional, evidence-based, confident (not defensive)
```
