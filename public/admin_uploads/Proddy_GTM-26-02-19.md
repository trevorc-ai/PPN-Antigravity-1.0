It's ready. Here's what you show Jason tomorrow:

Your three URLs, all live:

Page	URL	When to use
Partner Preview	ppnportal.net/partner-preview.html	Open this first. Start here. Scroll through it together.
Phantom Shield	ppnportal.net/phantom-shield.html	When he asks "what's the practitioner pitch?"
Share Card	ppnportal.net/phantom-shield-card.html	Hand him your phone. Let him scan the QR.

 on your laptop. He reads the hero: "The infrastructure psychedelic practice has been waiting for." Starfield background, pulsing badge, live links. He'll know immediately this is real.

Scroll to "What's Live" and click each link while he watches. Not a deck. Not a mockup. Every card opens an actual running URL. That's the moment.

Pull out your phone, open the share card and hand it to him. Tell him: "This is what you text people." Let him scan it himself. He sees the Phantom Shield overview load on his screen from a QR code. That's the field activation moment right there in the room.

Comma rule is now global. No em dashes in body text anywhere. WO-124 is filed and every agent knows it. Campaign assets are live. Let's go.

You recall, we are meeting several prominent market segments through our network. The first doctor we met with is nationally renowned formerly involved with national Institute health NIH and he is a Crusader for psychedelics. John Turner is a retired venture capital attorney and an avid lover of psychedelics late 60s still burning. Bridger Lee Jensen, out of Utah apparently runs one of the largest psilocybin churches in the nation. You probably talked about in the podcast. He's also in the news quite a bit dealing with the federal government and fighting for religious freedom. He is eagerly awaiting to see the PPN portal as well so these people that are standing by. We have Dr. Sheena Vander-Ploeg, a naturopathic doctor and business owner one of the highest energy people ever and she travels internationally quite a bit... let's see who else we have?


Hold on. I need you to see what you just laid out, because this isn't just a contact list. This is four completely different market segments all in one network, and each one needs PPN to say something different to them.

Let me map it while you think of who else:

The Network Map
Person	Segment	What They Need PPN to Be
Jason Bluth	Field Activator / Co-founder	The field distribution engine. He IS the campaign.
The NIH Doctor	Medical Legitimacy Anchor	A real-world evidence machine. Publishable data. Scientific rigor.
John Turner	Legal / Investment	Defensible IP. Regulatory moat. Market sizing. Exit thesis.
Bridger Lee Jensen	Ceremonial / Religious	This one deserves its own section (see below).
Dr. Sheena Vander-Ploeg	Naturopathic / International	Cross-jurisdiction tool. Integrative protocols. Business ROI.
The Bridger Lee Jensen Flag
This is potentially your most strategically significant contact and requires specific thinking.

Psilocybin churches operating under RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) protections are a legally distinct segment from the grey market. His fight with the federal government isn't the same legal exposure as an underground facilitator. His members aren't hiding. They're claiming a constitutional right and fighting for it openly.

What does Phantom Shield mean for a psilocybin church?

Ceremonial session documentation that demonstrates duty of care to members
Safety records that support the religious freedom legal argument ("We are not drug dealers. We have protocols.")
A network of church operators across the country who all need the same infrastructure
If Bridger Lee Jensen's church is one of the largest psilocybin churches in the country, and he brings PPN to his network, that's not just one customer. That's potentially dozens of affiliated churches, each with their own facilitators and members. That's a distribution channel, not a user.

What Each Person Sees When They Look at PPN
NIH Doctor: Show him the data architecture. The anonymized outcome aggregation. The real-world evidence potential. He's thinking: "Can I publish something from this dataset?"

John Turner (VC attorney): Show him the moat. Zero-PHI is a structural rebuild competitors can't copy. First-mover in a field about to be licensed. He's thinking: "Is this defensible? What's the IP? What's the exit?"

Bridger Lee Jensen: Show him Phantom Shield and the Crisis Logger. Specifically the audit defense framing. His congregation's sessions need to be documented in a way that supports his legal case, not undermines it. He's thinking: "Does this protect my people or create a paper trail?"

Dr. Sheena: Show her the protocol builder and the wellness journey tools. She travels internationally so she needs something that works across jurisdictions. She's thinking: "Does this fit my practice and my clients?"

Who else is in the network? Keep going. I'm building the full picture before I propose anything.
