## Time-Travel to 2026: The Psychedelic Renaissance Is Here

**Speaker 3:** Welcome back to the Deep Dive. So today we're doing something a little different. 

**Speaker 4:** A little bit of time travel. 

**Speaker 3:** Exactly. We're time traveling. We have this stack of documents in front of us, pitch decks, internal memos, strategic plans, and they're all dated February 11th, 2026. 

**Speaker 4:** So for our purposes, that's today.

It's a Wednesday in 2026. 

**Speaker 3:** It's a Wednesday, and if you've been, you know, walking around Portland or Denver or even New York, you know, this psychedelic renaissance thing isn't some future event. It's here. 

**Speaker 4:** Oh, it's absolutely here. The shift has been well, incredible. We've gone from these treatments being completely underground, 

**Speaker 3:** whisper spurs in basements.

**Speaker 4:** To this huge, legitimate clinical industry. I mean, the numbers in these sources are just staggering. There are over 3,500 interventional mood treatment sites in the US right now. 

**Speaker 3:** That is just explosive growth. Zero to three and half thousand in what? A few years. 

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, 


## The Industry’s Blind Spot: Clinics ‘Flying Blind’ Without Shared Data

**Speaker 3:** but, and there's always a, but when things grow this fast, these documents we're looking at suggests this whole field has a massive blind spot.

**Speaker 4:** It does. And it's the kind of blind spot that could, you know. Crash the entire system. The core problem is that with all this growth, the whole field is basically flying blind. 

**Speaker 3:** Flying blind. That phrase comes up a lot. 

**Speaker 4:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 3:** What does that actually feel like for a doctor, you know, on the ground? 

**Speaker 4:** Well, there's a great quote in here from a doctor Sheena Jaramillo.

She runs a Ketamine clinic out in Bend, 

**Speaker 3:** okay. 

**Speaker 4:** And she just nails it. She says something like, research progress is hampered by lack of comparable data. 

**Speaker 3:** That sounds a little academic. What does it mean in like real life? 

**Speaker 4:** It means every clinic is its own little island. You have a doctor in Ohio using one protocol for depression and another doctor in California using a totally different one.

**Speaker 3:** Drugs 

**Speaker 4:** or different dosing, different integration tools, different surveys to even measure if it worked. It's a total mess. 

**Speaker 3:** So it's like. Imagine if every heart doctor just made up their own way to measure blood pressure. 

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 3:** You could never say, oh, this medicine works better because no one agrees on.

What better even means 


## Meet PPN: A Real-Time Clinical Intelligence Platform (Not an EHR)

**Speaker 4:** you can't compare anything, and that is the problem that this company we're looking at today. The PTN research portal is trying to solve 

**Speaker 3:** their tagline's. Pretty simple. See what works before you treat 

**Speaker 4:** right 

**Speaker 3:** now, when I see the word portal, my mind immediately goes to those clunky websites where I.

Pay my hospital bull. Is that what this is? 

**Speaker 4:** No. And that's probably the most important thing to get straight right away. It is not an EHR, an electronic health record. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay. 

**Speaker 4:** And it's not practice management software. They're very specific. They call it a clinical intelligence platform. 

**Speaker 3:** Clinical intelligence.

That's a flashy term. Let's, you know, strip away the marketing. What job is this platform actually supposed to do? 

**Speaker 4:** Its job is speed. It's designed to solve what they call the cold start problem in research. The deck says they wanna do in 17 months, what took the field 17 years to do before? 

**Speaker 3:** Okay. 17 years isn't a random number.

That's a nod to someone, right? 

**Speaker 4:** It is, yeah. It's a nod to Dr. James Fatman. He's a legend. He spent 17 years collecting anonymous reports on microdosing, 

**Speaker 3:** and he proved the model. 

**Speaker 4:** He proved you could get huge scientific insights from anonymous data, but it was slow. It was looking backwards. PPN wants to take that same idea, but make it happen in real time, right?

When the doctor is with the patient. 


## From Autopsy Reports to Live Guidance: Split-Screen Clinical Intelligence Demo

**Speaker 3:** Let's dig into that because the old way, as they call it, sounds. Uh, honestly, it sounds pretty lonely for the doctor. 

**Speaker 4:** It is lonely and but terrifying. If you think about it right now, a doctor designs a protocol based on what their intuition, a seminar they went to two years ago.

**Speaker 3:** They treat the patient. Cross their fingers, 

**Speaker 4:** and then maybe weeks later they log the data. 

**Speaker 3:** So the data is basically an autopsy report. 

**Speaker 4:** That's a grim way to put it, but yeah, pretty much it tells you what happened, but it's way too late to change the outcome for that specific person, 

**Speaker 3:** right? The decision's already been made, 

**Speaker 4:** the value is gone.

**Speaker 3:** Okay, so let's flip to the new way. The pitch deck shows this interface called Split Screen Clinical Intelligence. Walk me through it. I'm the doctor. What am I seeing? 

**Speaker 4:** So picture your computer screen split right down the middle. On the left. You're doing your normal thing. You're typing in the patient's profile.

**Speaker 3:** So like age diagnosis. 

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. The demo they use is a patient age 36 to 45 with major depressive disorder, weighs between 61 and 70 kilograms. Then you type in your proposed treatment. 

**Speaker 3:** Let's see. Ketamine 40 V infusion, 

**Speaker 4:** right? Ketamine 0.5 milligrams per kilogram iv. So far, so normal. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay. That's just data entry.

That's boring, 

**Speaker 4:** right? But you have to watch the right side of the screen because as you're typing, that side is updating live. It's querying the entire network, 

**Speaker 3:** the whole database of other treatments 

**Speaker 4:** instantly, and for that patient with that profile and that drug, it pops up similar patients. 1 27. 

**Speaker 3:** So it found 127 other people who were just like my patient, 

**Speaker 4:** exactly like your patient.

And right below that, it shows you the outcome. 68% saw significant improvement. 

**Speaker 3:** Hold on though. If I'm a doctor, I'm trained to rely on my own judgment. Do I really trust a computer telling me what to do? Is this trying to replace the doctor? 

**Speaker 4:** That's the key question. But it doesn't seem like it's trying to replace them.

It's trying to give them like extra revision. 

**Speaker 3:** I see. 

**Speaker 4:** For example, it also shows something called receptor impact. It will tell a doctor this specific dose will result in 80%. NMDA antagonism. 

**Speaker 3:** Whoa. Okay, pause. NMDA antagonism. You gotta explain that like I'm five. What does that actually mean? 

**Speaker 4:** Fair enough.

Think of your brain like a huge circuit board with all these switches for mood and learning. The NMDA receptor is a master switch for, uh, brain plasticity. Antagonism just means turning that switch down for a little bit. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay, so the software isn't just saying, give this dose, it's saying this dose will flip this specific brain switch by this specific amount.

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. It connects the chemistry to the outcome. 


## Safety Alerts That Change Outcomes: Drug Interactions & Efficacy Warnings

**Speaker 4:** But here's the feature that I think is the real game changer. It's the safety alerts. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay? 

**Speaker 4:** In the demo, the system flags that the patient is also taking benzodiazepines, so Valium, Xanax, that kind of thing, 

**Speaker 3:** which is super common for people with depression or anxiety.

**Speaker 4:** Incredibly common, and a warning flashes on the screen. May reduce efficacy by 23%. Consider holding for 24 hours. 

**Speaker 3:** Now that is where the rubber meets the road, because if I didn't know that and the treatment didn't work, 

**Speaker 4:** you'd think the ketamine failed 

**Speaker 3:** or that the patient was treatment resistant. 

**Speaker 4:** Exactly.

But really it was just a drug interaction you didn't know about that one. Alert changes everything. You make the adjustment before you treat. You go from guessing to knowing 


## Privacy as the Moat: No PHI, Hashed IDs, and Network Benchmarking

**Speaker 3:** that sounds incredibly valuable, but anytime we talk about this kind of detailed medical data, we have to talk about privacy. IPA.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, 

**Speaker 3:** all that. 

**Speaker 4:** And this is where the company does something that at first seems totally counterintuitive. It's what they call their strategic moat, 

**Speaker 3:** usually in healthcare. The moat is having the best security, being the most HIPAA compliant, 

**Speaker 4:** right? A competitor, they mention Osmond, they chase HIPA compliance.

They have to store names, addresses, all that personal stuff. PPN does the exact opposite. They strictly refuse to collect any PHI protected health information. 

**Speaker 3:** They just say no. 

**Speaker 4:** They say no, no names, no birth dates, no addresses, nothing. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay, wait a minute. How is that useful? Then how do I track my patient?

Let's call her Jane Doe. Over six months. If the system has no idea who Jane Doe is, 

**Speaker 4:** that's the Blue Ocean instrument as they call it. They realize that PHI, the identifiable data is actually the thing that blocks research. 

**Speaker 3:** How does it block it? 

**Speaker 4:** Legally, you cannot share. Jane doe's record from clinic A with clinic B.

It's a legal firewall. But if you get rid of Jane doe's name 

**Speaker 3:** the firewall vanishes, 

**Speaker 4:** it's gone. 

**Speaker 3:** So how do they track the patient then? There has to be some kind of identifier. 

**Speaker 4:** They use something called hashed subject IDs. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay, break that down for me. 

**Speaker 4:** So imagine the clinic takes a photo of the patient, then they tear it in half, the clinic keeps the left half the face, the name, all the identifying stuff.

**Speaker 3:** And 

**Speaker 4:** P-P-N-P-P-N only ever sees the right half. The anonymous data, the vitals, the protocol, the outcome, the hash is like the unique jagged edge of the tear. 

**Speaker 3:** So the two has never meet on PPN server. 

**Speaker 4:** Never. The clinic's computer knows Jane Doe matches hash 1 23, right? But PPN server only ever sees hash 1 23.

**Speaker 3:** So if a hacker or the government, or anyone breaks into PPNs database, what do they find? 

**Speaker 4:** A bunch of numbers, no names, no locations. It's completely useless for identifying any single person. 

**Speaker 3:** That's really clever, and it's not just about saving money on compliance, so I'm sure that's a big part of it. 

**Speaker 4:** Oh, the savings are huge.

IPA compliance can cost a startup half a million dollars a year. PPN pays zero, but you're right. The liability is the real killer app here. 

**Speaker 3:** The average data breach costs what? 10, $11 million, 

**Speaker 4:** something like that. Ppms risk is zero. They hold nothing worth stealing. 

**Speaker 3:** It's like they're refusing to handle the toxic waste.

**Speaker 4:** That's the perfect way to put it. PHI is toxic waste. By not touching it, they can do the one thing. Their competitors can't network benchmarking. They can compare your patient to another one across the country instantly, because it's not patient records, it's just anonymous statistics. 


## The $999/Month Question: Pricing, ROI, and Malpractice Risk Reduction

**Speaker 3:** Okay, so the tech is smart, the privacy model is smart, but let's talk money.

They're asking clinics to pay $999 a month. Per site. 

**Speaker 4:** It's a bold price point. 

**Speaker 3:** It really is. I mean, most practice software is a few hundred bucks. 

**Speaker 4:** Mm. 

**Speaker 3:** A thousand dollars a month for a small clinic. 

**Speaker 4:** Mm. 

**Speaker 3:** It's a big ask. 

**Speaker 4:** It is. And their whole financial model hinges on justifying that price. Their argument is clinical decision support is worth three times more than data entry tools.

**Speaker 3:** Is it though? 

**Speaker 4:** Well think about the cost of one failed treatment. If that safety alert about the benzodiazepines prevents just one botched session, 

**Speaker 3:** that session costs the patient what? 600, $800? 

**Speaker 4:** Easily. So if you save just one or two of those a month, the platform has already paid for itself. Not to mention the liability, 

**Speaker 3:** right?

If I follow the network data, I'm practicing evidence-based medicine. If I'm just guessing, I'm opening myself up to malpractice. 

**Speaker 4:** So they're not really selling software, they're selling risk reduction. They're selling better outcomes, but. It is a big butt. 


## Beating the Cold Start: Lighthouse Practitioners, Network Density & Gamification

**Speaker 4:** This whole model has a massive, weak spot. We have to talk about the cold start problem 

**Speaker 3:** by chicken and the egg.

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. The cold start is the nightmare scenario. You're a doctor, it's week one. You paid your thousand bucks. You log in, you type in your patient's info, 

**Speaker 3:** and the right side of the screen is blank. 

**Speaker 4:** It's blank. It says, no data found, or maybe N equals 10, which is useless. And if you paid a thousand dollars for a blank screen, you're canceling that subscription immediately.

**Speaker 3:** So how do they get over that hump? How do they survive long enough for the data to become valuable? 

**Speaker 4:** They have a very specific three phase growth strategy. Phase one is happening right now in early 2026. They're focusing on what they call lighthouse practitioners, 

**Speaker 3:** the early adopters. The true believers, 

**Speaker 4:** people like that.

Dr. Jeremy, we mentioned the leaders who are willing to help build the data set for. The greater good. They're not buying it for the immediate value, 

**Speaker 3:** they're buying into the mission. 

**Speaker 4:** Right. And they need those people to get to what they call network density, which is around 20 to 50 sites. 

**Speaker 3:** And once you have 50 sites logging data every day, 

**Speaker 4:** the numbers start to get interesting very, very quickly.

They figure out they have a 12 to 24 month window. The first platform to hit a thousand distinct protocols becomes the industry standard. 

**Speaker 3:** It's a land grab. Race to density 

**Speaker 4:** and to win that race. They're also using gamification, 

**Speaker 3:** gamifying depression treatment. That sounds a little trivial. 

**Speaker 4:** It does, but you know, doctors can be competitive.

The platform offers things like benchmark badges. It'll show you your clinic success rate is 72%, but the network average is 68%. You're a top forma. 

**Speaker 3:** Ah, I see. So it strokes the ego or it lights a fire under you if you're below average. 

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. Your clinic. Versus the network. It turns boring data entry into a scoreboard.


## Legal Minefield: Psilocybin, FDA Lines, and ‘Scoreboard Not Coach’ Positioning

**Speaker 3:** Let's shift to the other risks beyond the cold start. There's the whole legal landscape that's psychedelics after all Ketamine is legal, but what about psilocybin? MDMA, 

**Speaker 4:** it's an absolute minefield. Psilocybin is legal in a couple of states, but federally it's still schedule one highly illegal. 

**Speaker 3:** So if I'm a clinic in Oregon using psilocybin, and I enter that data into PPN, am I basically confessing to a federal crime?

**Speaker 4:** And that brings us right back to the genius of the no PHI model. Ah, since PPN has no idea who the patient is. They aren't hosting a record of illegal activity tied to a specific person. 

**Speaker 3:** They have plausible deniability, 

**Speaker 4:** total deniability. They can say, we're just research infrastructure. We don't know who these people are.

They're so careful with their language. They call it quality improvement. They never make medical device claims, 

**Speaker 3:** so they're not telling doctors what to do. 

**Speaker 4:** Never. They just say, here's what the data shows. They're the scoreboard, not the coach. That's how they keep the FDA off their backs 

**Speaker 3:** for now at least.

It's a fine line to walk 

**Speaker 4:** a very fine line. 


## Inside the Culture: NotebookLM Audio Briefings and a Lean Operator Mindset

**Speaker 3:** I wanna touch on one more thing from the notes under operational efficiency. It's a small detail, but I thought it was fascinating. The notebook, LM strategy. 

**Speaker 4:** Yes. This really says a lot about the company's culture. 

**Speaker 3:** The founder, a guy named PPN Admin, apparently he hates making PowerPoint slides, 

**Speaker 4:** hates it.

The memo says they use AI tools specifically notebook LM, to generate audio briefings for investors. Instead of a 50 page slide deck, they just send a 10 minute AI generated audio file. 

**Speaker 3:** That's so interesting because it's a mirror of the product itself. The product strips away the fluff, the PI, to get to the real value of the data.

**Speaker 4:** The management style strips away, the corporate fluff, the slide decks to get to the core message. It's a signal to investors that they're a lean tech forward, no nonsense operation. 


## 2030 Vision: Turning Every Session Into Research—and Beyond Psychedelics

**Speaker 3:** So let's zoom out. We're here in 2026. 

**Speaker 4:** Mm. 

**Speaker 3:** If this company, PPN, survives the cold start, if they navigate all the legal stuff, 

**Speaker 4:** yeah.

**Speaker 3:** What does the world look like in 2030? 

**Speaker 4:** Their year five vision is over a thousand sites logging more than half a million protocols. The goal is to, and this is a quote, turn every clinical encounter into a research contribution. 

**Speaker 3:** That's a really powerful idea right now. Most clinical data just. Evaporates.

It dies in a file cabinet somewhere. 

**Speaker 4:** It's an incredible amount of waste. They wanna capture all of it. They wanna move psychedelic therapy from being an art based on a practitioner's gut feeling to a science based on hard numbers. 

**Speaker 3:** And if they pull that off, they could legitimize the entire field. 

**Speaker 4:** That's the key.

You want insurance to cover this stuff. You need data. You want the federal government to reschedule these drugs. You need data, not anecdotes, cold hard data. 


## Final Takeaway: Privacy vs Progress, and Whether PPN Survives

**Speaker 4:** So here's 

**Speaker 3:** the final question for you to think about. We've been talking about psychedelics this whole time, but if this model actually works, this no PHI anonymous realtime intelligence, why would it stop there?

**Speaker 4:** And that is the really provocative question, isn't it? Mm-hmm. If PPN can prove that anonymous data is actually more valuable for research than our detailed lockdown medical records, 

**Speaker 3:** does this completely upend how we do all of medicine. 

**Speaker 4:** Why not imagine an oncologist typing in a tumor's genetic profile and instantly seeing the outcomes for 10,000 other patients with that exact same mutation without ever knowing their names?

**Speaker 3:** You kind of suggest that our obsession with privacy with IPA might actually be harming us by slowing down research. 

**Speaker 4:** It's the ultimate trade off, right? We've chosen privacy over progress. PPN is making a bet that you can have both if you just stop caring about the names and start caring about the numbers 

**Speaker 3:** from flying blind to seeing the future.

It's a huge bet. 

**Speaker 4:** It is. We'll just have to see if they can survive that cold start. 

**Speaker 3:** We will. 

**Speaker 4:** That's all for today's deep dive. Thanks for listening. We'll see you on the next one.
