# Scaling\_Psychedelic\_Medicine\_With\_Anonymous\_Data


## Time-Travel to 2026: The Psychedelic Renaissance Is Here

**Speaker 3:** Welcome back to the Deep Dive. So today we're doing something a little different. 

**Speaker 4:** A little bit of time travel. 

**Speaker 3:** Exactly. We're time traveling. We have this stack of documents in front of us, pitch decks, internal memos, strategic plans, and they're all dated February 11th, 2026. 

**Speaker 4:** So for our purposes, that's today.

It's a Wednesday in 2026. 

**Speaker 3:** It's a Wednesday, and if you've been, you know, walking around Portland or Denver or even New York, you know, this psychedelic renaissance thing isn't some future event. It's here. 

**Speaker 4:** Oh, it's absolutely here. The shift has been well, incredible. We've gone from these treatments being completely underground, 

**Speaker 3:** whisper spurs in basements.

**Speaker 4:** To this huge, legitimate clinical industry. I mean, the numbers in these sources are just staggering. There are over 3,500 interventional mood treatment sites in the US right now. 

**Speaker 3:** That is just explosive growth. Zero to three and half thousand in what? A few years. 

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, 


## The Industry’s Blind Spot: Clinics ‘Flying Blind’ Without Shared Data

**Speaker 3:** but, and there's always a, but when things grow this fast, these documents we're looking at suggests this whole field has a massive blind spot.

**Speaker 4:** It does. And it's the kind of blind spot that could, you know. Crash the entire system. The core problem is that with all this growth, the whole field is basically flying blind. 

**Speaker 3:** Flying blind. That phrase comes up a lot. 

**Speaker 4:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 3:** What does that actually feel like for a doctor, you know, on the ground? 

**Speaker 4:** Well, there's a great quote in here from a doctor Sheena Jaramillo.

She runs a Ketamine clinic out in Bend, 

**Speaker 3:** okay. 

**Speaker 4:** And she just nails it. She says something like, research progress is hampered by lack of comparable data. 

**Speaker 3:** That sounds a little academic. What does it mean in like real life? 

**Speaker 4:** It means every clinic is its own little island. You have a doctor in Ohio using one protocol for depression and another doctor in California using a totally different one.

**Speaker 3:** Drugs 

**Speaker 4:** or different dosing, different integration tools, different surveys to even measure if it worked. It's a total mess. 

**Speaker 3:** So it's like. Imagine if every heart doctor just made up their own way to measure blood pressure. 

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 3:** You could never say, oh, this medicine works better because no one agrees on.

What better even means 


## Meet PPN: A Real-Time Clinical Intelligence Platform (Not an EHR)

**Speaker 4:** you can't compare anything, and that is the problem that this company we're looking at today. The PTN research portal is trying to solve 

**Speaker 3:** their tagline's. Pretty simple. See what works before you treat 

**Speaker 4:** right 

**Speaker 3:** now, when I see the word portal, my mind immediately goes to those clunky websites where I.

Pay my hospital bull. Is that what this is? 

**Speaker 4:** No. And that's probably the most important thing to get straight right away. It is not an EHR, an electronic health record. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay. 

**Speaker 4:** And it's not practice management software. They're very specific. They call it a clinical intelligence platform. 

**Speaker 3:** Clinical intelligence.

That's a flashy term. Let's, you know, strip away the marketing. What job is this platform actually supposed to do? 

**Speaker 4:** Its job is speed. It's designed to solve what they call the cold start problem in research. The deck says they wanna do in 17 months, what took the field 17 years to do before? 

**Speaker 3:** Okay. 17 years isn't a random number.

That's a nod to someone, right? 

**Speaker 4:** It is, yeah. It's a nod to Dr. James Fatman. He's a legend. He spent 17 years collecting anonymous reports on microdosing, 

**Speaker 3:** and he proved the model. 

**Speaker 4:** He proved you could get huge scientific insights from anonymous data, but it was slow. It was looking backwards. PPN wants to take that same idea, but make it happen in real time, right?

When the doctor is with the patient. 


## From Autopsy Reports to Live Guidance: Split-Screen Clinical Intelligence Demo

**Speaker 3:** Let's dig into that because the old way, as they call it, sounds. Uh, honestly, it sounds pretty lonely for the doctor. 

**Speaker 4:** It is lonely and but terrifying. If you think about it right now, a doctor designs a protocol based on what their intuition, a seminar they went to two years ago.

**Speaker 3:** They treat the patient. Cross their fingers, 

**Speaker 4:** and then maybe weeks later they log the data. 

**Speaker 3:** So the data is basically an autopsy report. 

**Speaker 4:** That's a grim way to put it, but yeah, pretty much it tells you what happened, but it's way too late to change the outcome for that specific person, 

**Speaker 3:** right? The decision's already been made, 

**Speaker 4:** the value is gone.

**Speaker 3:** Okay, so let's flip to the new way. The pitch deck shows this interface called Split Screen Clinical Intelligence. Walk me through it. I'm the doctor. What am I seeing? 

**Speaker 4:** So picture your computer screen split right down the middle. On the left. You're doing your normal thing. You're typing in the patient's profile.

**Speaker 3:** So like age diagnosis. 

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. The demo they use is a patient age 36 to 45 with major depressive disorder, weighs between 61 and 70 kilograms. Then you type in your proposed treatment. 

**Speaker 3:** Let's see. Ketamine 40 V infusion, 

**Speaker 4:** right? Ketamine 0.5 milligrams per kilogram iv. So far, so normal. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay. That's just data entry.

That's boring, 

**Speaker 4:** right? But you have to watch the right side of the screen because as you're typing, that side is updating live. It's querying the entire network, 

**Speaker 3:** the whole database of other treatments 

**Speaker 4:** instantly, and for that patient with that profile and that drug, it pops up similar patients. 1 27. 

**Speaker 3:** So it found 127 other people who were just like my patient, 

**Speaker 4:** exactly like your patient.

And right below that, it shows you the outcome. 68% saw significant improvement. 

**Speaker 3:** Hold on though. If I'm a doctor, I'm trained to rely on my own judgment. Do I really trust a computer telling me what to do? Is this trying to replace the doctor? 

**Speaker 4:** That's the key question. But it doesn't seem like it's trying to replace them.

It's trying to give them like extra revision. 

**Speaker 3:** I see. 

**Speaker 4:** For example, it also shows something called receptor impact. It will tell a doctor this specific dose will result in 80%. NMDA antagonism. 

**Speaker 3:** Whoa. Okay, pause. NMDA antagonism. You gotta explain that like I'm five. What does that actually mean? 

**Speaker 4:** Fair enough.

Think of your brain like a huge circuit board with all these switches for mood and learning. The NMDA receptor is a master switch for, uh, brain plasticity. Antagonism just means turning that switch down for a little bit. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay, so the software isn't just saying, give this dose, it's saying this dose will flip this specific brain switch by this specific amount.

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. It connects the chemistry to the outcome. 


## Safety Alerts That Change Outcomes: Drug Interactions & Efficacy Warnings

**Speaker 4:** But here's the feature that I think is the real game changer. It's the safety alerts. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay? 

**Speaker 4:** In the demo, the system flags that the patient is also taking benzodiazepines, so Valium, Xanax, that kind of thing, 

**Speaker 3:** which is super common for people with depression or anxiety.

**Speaker 4:** Incredibly common, and a warning flashes on the screen. May reduce efficacy by 23%. Consider holding for 24 hours. 

**Speaker 3:** Now that is where the rubber meets the road, because if I didn't know that and the treatment didn't work, 

**Speaker 4:** you'd think the ketamine failed 

**Speaker 3:** or that the patient was treatment resistant. 

**Speaker 4:** Exactly.

But really it was just a drug interaction you didn't know about that one. Alert changes everything. You make the adjustment before you treat. You go from guessing to knowing 


## Privacy as the Moat: No PHI, Hashed IDs, and Network Benchmarking

**Speaker 3:** that sounds incredibly valuable, but anytime we talk about this kind of detailed medical data, we have to talk about privacy. IPA.

**Speaker 4:** Yeah, 

**Speaker 3:** all that. 

**Speaker 4:** And this is where the company does something that at first seems totally counterintuitive. It's what they call their strategic moat, 

**Speaker 3:** usually in healthcare. The moat is having the best security, being the most HIPAA compliant, 

**Speaker 4:** right? A competitor, they mention Osmond, they chase HIPA compliance.

They have to store names, addresses, all that personal stuff. PPN does the exact opposite. They strictly refuse to collect any PHI protected health information. 

**Speaker 3:** They just say no. 

**Speaker 4:** They say no, no names, no birth dates, no addresses, nothing. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay, wait a minute. How is that useful? Then how do I track my patient?

Let's call her Jane Doe. Over six months. If the system has no idea who Jane Doe is, 

**Speaker 4:** that's the Blue Ocean instrument as they call it. They realize that PHI, the identifiable data is actually the thing that blocks research. 

**Speaker 3:** How does it block it? 

**Speaker 4:** Legally, you cannot share. Jane doe's record from clinic A with clinic B.

It's a legal firewall. But if you get rid of Jane doe's name 

**Speaker 3:** the firewall vanishes, 

**Speaker 4:** it's gone. 

**Speaker 3:** So how do they track the patient then? There has to be some kind of identifier. 

**Speaker 4:** They use something called hashed subject IDs. 

**Speaker 3:** Okay, break that down for me. 

**Speaker 4:** So imagine the clinic takes a photo of the patient, then they tear it in half, the clinic keeps the left half the face, the name, all the identifying stuff.

**Speaker 3:** And 

**Speaker 4:** P-P-N-P-P-N only ever sees the right half. The anonymous data, the vitals, the protocol, the outcome, the hash is like the unique jagged edge of the tear. 

**Speaker 3:** So the two has never meet on PPN server. 

**Speaker 4:** Never. The clinic's computer knows Jane Doe matches hash 1 23, right? But PPN server only ever sees hash 1 23.

**Speaker 3:** So if a hacker or the government, or anyone breaks into PPNs database, what do they find? 

**Speaker 4:** A bunch of numbers, no names, no locations. It's completely useless for identifying any single person. 

**Speaker 3:** That's really clever, and it's not just about saving money on compliance, so I'm sure that's a big part of it. 

**Speaker 4:** Oh, the savings are huge.

IPA compliance can cost a startup half a million dollars a year. PPN pays zero, but you're right. The liability is the real killer app here. 

**Speaker 3:** The average data breach costs what? 10, $11 million, 

**Speaker 4:** something like that. Ppms risk is zero. They hold nothing worth stealing. 

**Speaker 3:** It's like they're refusing to handle the toxic waste.

**Speaker 4:** That's the perfect way to put it. PHI is toxic waste. By not touching it, they can do the one thing. Their competitors can't network benchmarking. They can compare your patient to another one across the country instantly, because it's not patient records, it's just anonymous statistics. 


## The $999/Month Question: Pricing, ROI, and Malpractice Risk Reduction

**Speaker 3:** Okay, so the tech is smart, the privacy model is smart, but let's talk money.

They're asking clinics to pay $999 a month. Per site. 

**Speaker 4:** It's a bold price point. 

**Speaker 3:** It really is. I mean, most practice software is a few hundred bucks. 

**Speaker 4:** Mm. 

**Speaker 3:** A thousand dollars a month for a small clinic. 

**Speaker 4:** Mm. 

**Speaker 3:** It's a big ask. 

**Speaker 4:** It is. And their whole financial model hinges on justifying that price. Their argument is clinical decision support is worth three times more than data entry tools.

**Speaker 3:** Is it though? 

**Speaker 4:** Well think about the cost of one failed treatment. If that safety alert about the benzodiazepines prevents just one botched session, 

**Speaker 3:** that session costs the patient what? 600, $800? 

**Speaker 4:** Easily. So if you save just one or two of those a month, the platform has already paid for itself. Not to mention the liability, 

**Speaker 3:** right?

If I follow the network data, I'm practicing evidence-based medicine. If I'm just guessing, I'm opening myself up to malpractice. 

**Speaker 4:** So they're not really selling software, they're selling risk reduction. They're selling better outcomes, but. It is a big butt. 


## Beating the Cold Start: Lighthouse Practitioners, Network Density & Gamification

**Speaker 4:** This whole model has a massive, weak spot. We have to talk about the cold start problem 

**Speaker 3:** by chicken and the egg.

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. The cold start is the nightmare scenario. You're a doctor, it's week one. You paid your thousand bucks. You log in, you type in your patient's info, 

**Speaker 3:** and the right side of the screen is blank. 

**Speaker 4:** It's blank. It says, no data found, or maybe N equals 10, which is useless. And if you paid a thousand dollars for a blank screen, you're canceling that subscription immediately.

**Speaker 3:** So how do they get over that hump? How do they survive long enough for the data to become valuable? 

**Speaker 4:** They have a very specific three phase growth strategy. Phase one is happening right now in early 2026. They're focusing on what they call lighthouse practitioners, 

**Speaker 3:** the early adopters. The true believers, 

**Speaker 4:** people like that.

Dr. Jeremy, we mentioned the leaders who are willing to help build the data set for. The greater good. They're not buying it for the immediate value, 

**Speaker 3:** they're buying into the mission. 

**Speaker 4:** Right. And they need those people to get to what they call network density, which is around 20 to 50 sites. 

**Speaker 3:** And once you have 50 sites logging data every day, 

**Speaker 4:** the numbers start to get interesting very, very quickly.

They figure out they have a 12 to 24 month window. The first platform to hit a thousand distinct protocols becomes the industry standard. 

**Speaker 3:** It's a land grab. Race to density 

**Speaker 4:** and to win that race. They're also using gamification, 

**Speaker 3:** gamifying depression treatment. That sounds a little trivial. 

**Speaker 4:** It does, but you know, doctors can be competitive.

The platform offers things like benchmark badges. It'll show you your clinic success rate is 72%, but the network average is 68%. You're a top forma. 

**Speaker 3:** Ah, I see. So it strokes the ego or it lights a fire under you if you're below average. 

**Speaker 4:** Exactly. Your clinic. Versus the network. It turns boring data entry into a scoreboard.


## Legal Minefield: Psilocybin, FDA Lines, and ‘Scoreboard Not Coach’ Positioning

**Speaker 3:** Let's shift to the other risks beyond the cold start. There's the whole legal landscape that's psychedelics after all Ketamine is legal, but what about psilocybin? MDMA, 

**Speaker 4:** it's an absolute minefield. Psilocybin is legal in a couple of states, but federally it's still schedule one highly illegal. 

**Speaker 3:** So if I'm a clinic in Oregon using psilocybin, and I enter that data into PPN, am I basically confessing to a federal crime?

**Speaker 4:** And that brings us right back to the genius of the no PHI model. Ah, since PPN has no idea who the patient is. They aren't hosting a record of illegal activity tied to a specific person. 

**Speaker 3:** They have plausible deniability, 

**Speaker 4:** total deniability. They can say, we're just research infrastructure. We don't know who these people are.

They're so careful with their language. They call it quality improvement. They never make medical device claims, 

**Speaker 3:** so they're not telling doctors what to do. 

**Speaker 4:** Never. They just say, here's what the data shows. They're the scoreboard, not the coach. That's how they keep the FDA off their backs 

**Speaker 3:** for now at least.

It's a fine line to walk 

**Speaker 4:** a very fine line. 


## Inside the Culture: NotebookLM Audio Briefings and a Lean Operator Mindset

**Speaker 3:** I wanna touch on one more thing from the notes under operational efficiency. It's a small detail, but I thought it was fascinating. The notebook, LM strategy. 

**Speaker 4:** Yes. This really says a lot about the company's culture. 

**Speaker 3:** The founder, a guy named PPN Admin, apparently he hates making PowerPoint slides, 

**Speaker 4:** hates it.

The memo says they use AI tools specifically notebook LM, to generate audio briefings for investors. Instead of a 50 page slide deck, they just send a 10 minute AI generated audio file. 

**Speaker 3:** That's so interesting because it's a mirror of the product itself. The product strips away the fluff, the PI, to get to the real value of the data.

**Speaker 4:** The management style strips away, the corporate fluff, the slide decks to get to the core message. It's a signal to investors that they're a lean tech forward, no nonsense operation. 


## 2030 Vision: Turning Every Session Into Research—and Beyond Psychedelics

**Speaker 3:** So let's zoom out. We're here in 2026. 

**Speaker 4:** Mm. 

**Speaker 3:** If this company, PPN, survives the cold start, if they navigate all the legal stuff, 

**Speaker 4:** yeah.

**Speaker 3:** What does the world look like in 2030? 

**Speaker 4:** Their year five vision is over a thousand sites logging more than half a million protocols. The goal is to, and this is a quote, turn every clinical encounter into a research contribution. 

**Speaker 3:** That's a really powerful idea right now. Most clinical data just. Evaporates.

It dies in a file cabinet somewhere. 

**Speaker 4:** It's an incredible amount of waste. They wanna capture all of it. They wanna move psychedelic therapy from being an art based on a practitioner's gut feeling to a science based on hard numbers. 

**Speaker 3:** And if they pull that off, they could legitimize the entire field. 

**Speaker 4:** That's the key.

You want insurance to cover this stuff. You need data. You want the federal government to reschedule these drugs. You need data, not anecdotes, cold hard data. 


## Final Takeaway: Privacy vs Progress, and Whether PPN Survives

**Speaker 4:** So here's 

**Speaker 3:** the final question for you to think about. We've been talking about psychedelics this whole time, but if this model actually works, this no PHI anonymous realtime intelligence, why would it stop there?

**Speaker 4:** And that is the really provocative question, isn't it? Mm-hmm. If PPN can prove that anonymous data is actually more valuable for research than our detailed lockdown medical records, 

**Speaker 3:** does this completely upend how we do all of medicine. 

**Speaker 4:** Why not imagine an oncologist typing in a tumor's genetic profile and instantly seeing the outcomes for 10,000 other patients with that exact same mutation without ever knowing their names?

**Speaker 3:** You kind of suggest that our obsession with privacy with IPA might actually be harming us by slowing down research. 

**Speaker 4:** It's the ultimate trade off, right? We've chosen privacy over progress. PPN is making a bet that you can have both if you just stop caring about the names and start caring about the numbers 

**Speaker 3:** from flying blind to seeing the future.

It's a huge bet. 

**Speaker 4:** It is. We'll just have to see if they can survive that cold start. 

**Speaker 3:** We will. 

**Speaker 4:** That's all for today's deep dive. Thanks for listening. We'll see you on the next one.

# Scaling\_Psychedelic\_Therapy\_Without\_Patient\_Names


## Psychedelic Mental Health ‘Gold Rush’—Hype vs. Reality

**Speaker 9:** If you look at the headlines coming outta the mental health space right now, yeah. You get this, this just overwhelming sense of momentum. It feels like a revolution. 

**Speaker 10:** Oh, absolutely. It definitely feels like a gold rush. 

**Speaker 9:** You have ketamine, clinics popping up in strip malls. Psilocybin is legal and running in Oregon.

MDMA is knocking on the FDA's door from the outside. It looks like we've finally cracked the code. 

**Speaker 10:** It does. There's a lot of energy, a lot of capital, and you know, a lot of hope. 

**Speaker 9:** But that's the view from 30,000 feet. 


## The Wild West Problem: 3,500 Clinics, Zero Shared Outcomes

**Speaker 9:** When you actually land on the ground and look at the sources we have today, a pitch deck and memos for a platform called the PPN Research Portal.

You realize the foundation of this revolution is well, incredibly shaky, right? We're looking at something like 3,500 interventional mood treatment sites in the US alone. That is a massive number. Yeah, but do you know what the aggregate data says about what those 3,500 clinics are actually doing? 

**Speaker 10:** The short answer is nobody knows.

**Speaker 9:** That's terrifying. 

**Speaker 10:** It is the definition of fragmentation, and the sources describe this current landscape, not as a well-oiled machine, but as the Wild West. 

**Speaker 9:** The wild west, 

**Speaker 10:** you have thousands of practitioners all operating on their own little islands. They're developing their own protocols, using their own intuition, and essentially guessing at best practices because they just aren't sharing notes.

**Speaker 9:** There's a quote in here from a Dr. Sheena jar. She runs the Ben Ketamine clinic and she puts it bluntly. She says, research progress is hampered by lack of comparable data. 

**Speaker 10:** That's a very polite way of saying we're flying blind. I mean, think about it. If Dr. Ger Milow finds a specific dosing protocol that works perfectly for, say, a 40-year-old male with treatment resistant depression, the clinic down the street has absolutely no way of knowing that they might be using a protocol that failed five years ago.

**Speaker 9:** So everyone is reinventing the wheel. Every single day. 

**Speaker 10:** Ah, 

**Speaker 9:** in every single clinic. 

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. And that inefficiency isn't just annoying, it's dangerous, it slows down progress, and it leads to suboptimal care. 


## PPN Research Portal: ‘See What Works Before You Treat’

**Speaker 10:** And that is the core problem the PPN research portal is designed to solve. 

**Speaker 9:** And their mission statement is pretty clear.

See what works. Before you treat, 

**Speaker 10:** that tagline is doing a lot of heavy lifting. It signals a shift from treating psychedelic therapy as an art, where a doctor just kind of feels it out 

**Speaker 9:** based on vibes, 

**Speaker 10:** right? Based on vibes to a hard data-driven science. 

**Speaker 9:** So today we're gonna unpack three specific pillars of their strategy.

First, we have to talk about the interface itself, something they call the split screen, which completely changes the timeline of how a doctor makes a decision. 

**Speaker 10:** It moves them from being reactive to being perspective. 

**Speaker 9:** Second, we need to look at their data strategy. It is incredibly counterintuitive in an age where everyone wants your data.

PPN is deliberately refusing to collect patient names or identifiers, 

**Speaker 10:** and this isn't just for privacy. It's actually a brilliant legal and competitive maneuver. 

**Speaker 9:** It's arguably the smartest part of the whole model. 

**Speaker 10:** I'd agree. 

**Speaker 9:** And finally, the network effect. How do you take a field that moves at. Let's be honest to glacial pace and speed it up by maybe 10 or 20 years.

**Speaker 10:** Hmm. 


## Status Quo Breakdown: Retroactive Logging & Rearview-Mirror Care

**Speaker 9:** So let's start with that immediate problem, the timeline of care. 

**Speaker 10:** Right? To understand why PPN is different, you have to understand the status quo. The documents refer to the current standard as. Retroactive logging, 

**Speaker 9:** which just sounds like homework. 

**Speaker 10:** It basically is, imagine you're a doctor. You have a patient sitting in the chair.

You have to make a decision on the spot, let's say 60 milligrams of ketamine via fee. You administer it, the patient goes home, and then maybe a week later, or at the end of the day, you log those results into your electronic health record, your EHR, 

**Speaker 9:** you're just typing into a void. 

**Speaker 10:** Essentially you're creating a record of what happened, but that record didn't help you make the decision in the moment.

The needle is already out of the arm. The opportunity to optimize that treatment is gone. 

**Speaker 9:** You're driving the car by looking in the rear view mirror. 

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 9:** So PPN is trying to flip that mirror around. They call it prospective intelligence. 


## The Split-Screen Demo: Real-Time Decision Support in the Intake

**Speaker 10:** And the visual for this is the split screen. 

**Speaker 9:** Okay, let's visualize this for you.

The slide on the deck literally shows a computer monitor. Just cut right down the middle. 

**Speaker 10:** On the left side, you have practitioner inputs. This is the present moment. The doctor's doing the intake. They're typing in the patient profile. 

**Speaker 9:** Let's play this out. Let's use a specific scenario because the idea is cool, but I wanna know what it looks like in practice.

Let's say I'm a doctor, new patient, male, 42 years old. Major depressive disorder weighs about, um. 75 kilograms. 

**Speaker 10:** Okay. Pretty standard profile. The doctor types that in on the left. 

**Speaker 9:** Well, let's add a wrinkle. Let's say this patient is currently taking one milligram of clonazepam daily for anxiety. That's a benzodiazepine.

**Speaker 10:** That is a crucial detail. So the doctor types clonazepam one milligram on the left side. 

**Speaker 9:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 10:** As they're typing the right side of the screen, which is labeled live data intelligence is updating in real time. It's filtering the entire network's history to find matches for that specific profile. 

**Speaker 9:** So before the doctor even finishes the sentence.

The system is crunching the numbers from thousands of other cases. 

**Speaker 10:** Correct. And it might pop up and say, similar patients in network N one two A seven, and right underneath that a benchmark 68% significant improvement. 

**Speaker 9:** So right off the bat you aren't guessing, you know the statistical odds of success. For a person who looks just like this, 


## Safety \+ Biology in Context: Benzos, Efficacy Drops, Better Protocols

**Speaker 10:** but here's where the decision support gets really granular.

You mentioned the clonazepam. In a standard clinic, a doctor might just think, okay, anxiety meds, that's fine. We'll just proceed. 

**Speaker 9:** But the PPN system flags it. 

**Speaker 10:** It flashes a safety alert on the right side. Something like benzodiazepines may reduce efficacy by 23%. 

**Speaker 9:** Wow. That is a massive drop. You're losing a quarter of the benefit before you even start, 

**Speaker 10:** and the system even explains why.

The deck mentions these visualizations for receptor impact. It can show that ketamine works by creating a glutamatergic surge. It excites the neurons. Benzodiazepines do the exact opposite. They dampen neuronal activity. They literally fight the treatment. 

**Speaker 9:** So the system isn't just saying, don't do it. 

**Speaker 10:** Mm.

**Speaker 9:** It is showing the biology. It's saying if you do this, you are pressing the gas and the brake at the exact same time. 

**Speaker 10:** Precisely. And then it offers a protocol suggestion. Consider holding benzodiazepine for 24 hours prior to treatment. 

**Speaker 9:** That is the difference between a wasted session and a breakthrough.

And the key is that this all happens before the treatment. 

**Speaker 10:** That's the perspective part. It turns the doctor from a lone wolf, you know, relying on their gut into a node in a massive network. They have the collective intelligence of every other doctor right there on the screen. 


## Benchmarking Clinics: Network Averages, Quality Loops, ‘Commoditizing Excellence’

**Speaker 9:** It also brings up a competitive angle that I found really interesting.

The deck mentions network benchmarks. 

**Speaker 10:** Ah, yes. This is the part that might make some doctors a little uncomfortable, but it's vital for the industry. The system shows your clinic's success rate right next to the network average. 

**Speaker 9:** So if my clinic is getting 50% results with these kinds of patients, and the network is averaging 70%.

**Speaker 10:** You know immediately that you are doing something wrong. You can't hide from the data. It forces a quality improvement loop, 

**Speaker 9:** which might be stressful for the doctor. But if I'm a patient, that is exactly what I want. I want my doctor to know they're underperforming so they can fix it. 

**Speaker 10:** It commoditizes excellence.

It makes high performance the standard, not the exception. 


## The No-PHI Data Strategy: Privacy, Cost, and Breach-Proofing

**Speaker 9:** So to build a system like this that can tell you that benzos reduce efficacy by 23%, you need data, you need a lot of it, 

**Speaker 10:** a staggering amount. 

**Speaker 9:** And usually in the tech world, when a company says, give us all your data, we get skeptical. We think about surveillance, about ad targeting, 

**Speaker 10:** and in healthcare it's even stickier because of hyper.

**Speaker 9:** But PPN has taken a completely different route, and I have to admit, when I first read the no PHI memo, I thought I was misreading it. Their strategy is to collect zero personal information, 

**Speaker 10:** right? No names, no addresses, no birth dates, no social security numbers, nothing that can identify you as a human being.

**Speaker 9:** So yeah. Why? In a world where data is the new oil, why would you deliberately refuse to drill? For the most valuable part, the user's identity, 

**Speaker 10:** it's a fascinating strategic choice. It comes down to two things, defensive costs and offensive freedom. 

**Speaker 9:** Let's talk about the cost first. 

**Speaker 10:** The memo breaks this down pretty clearly.

To be hyper compliant, to legally hold that patient data costs a startup about half a million dollars a year. You need compliance officers, secure servers, complex audits. It's heavy infrastructure, 

**Speaker 9:** and that's just the cost of doing business. That doesn't even include the risk of messing up 

**Speaker 10:** and that risk is existential.

The average healthcare data breach to liability is over $10 million. If you're a startup and you leak patient records, especially records involving mental health and you know, psychedelic drug use, you are done. You're finished. 

**Speaker 9:** So, PPN looked at this and said, if we don't hold the toxic asset, the identity, we don't have the risk.

Their compliance cost is zero 

**Speaker 10:** and their breach risk is effectively zero. If hackers broke into PPN tomorrow, all they'd find is a bunch of numbers and drug dosages. They wouldn't know who subject 1 23 is. 

**Speaker 9:** That's the defense. 


## Blue Ocean Advantage: De-Identified Data That Competitors Can’t Share

**Speaker 9:** But you mentioned offensive freedom. This connects to what they call their Blue ocean strategy.

**Speaker 10:** This is the really clever part. PPN has competitors. Of course there are companies like Osmond, but Osmond is an electronic health record system, an EHR. They have to hold the names 'cause they handle billing and scheduling. They need to know where to send the invoice. 

**Speaker 9:** They're the digital file cabinet.

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. But because they're the file cabinet, they are legally locked inside the office. ICA makes it incredibly difficult to share that data between clinics. You can't just take patient a's data from a clinic in New York and compare it to patient B in California without a mountain of legal hurdles. 

**Speaker 9:** So Osmond has the data, but it's siloed, it's trapped.

**Speaker 10:** PPN, because they strip the identifiers at the source. The data is legally considered, de-identified. It's fluid. They can aggregate data from a thousand different clinics into one giant pool without breaking a single law. 

**Speaker 9:** That's the moat. They can build a data set that their competitors are legally forbidden from building.

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. Osmond literally isn't allowed to do what PPN is doing because they know too much about the patient. 


## Hashed Subject IDs & Small-Cell Suppression: Longitudinal Tracking Without Names

**Speaker 9:** But I have to play devil's advocate here. If they don't know who the patient is, how is the tool useful over time? I mean, mental health isn't a one-time thing. If I come in for six sessions over six months, how does the system know that Session six is the same person as session one?

**Speaker 10:** That is the technical hurdle. They had to clear, they solved it with something called hashed subject IDs, 

**Speaker 9:** hashed IDs. Okay, break that down for us. 

**Speaker 10:** Think of it like a secret code generator. When the doctor enters the patient's info locally, say clinic ID plus initials, plus birth year, the software runs it through an algorithm, a hash function, 

**Speaker 9:** and that algorithm just spits out a code, 

**Speaker 10:** right?

A unique string of characters, let's say subject X nine, Y two. Every time that doctor enters those same details for that patient, the system generates the exact same code so the doctor can track their patient's progress over months. 

**Speaker 9:** But PPN. On their end, 

**Speaker 10:** PPN only ever sees subject X nine Y two. They can't reverse engineer the code to get the name back.

It allows for longitudinal tracking following the patient through time without the surveillance. 

**Speaker 9:** It's a really clever workaround. It preserves the science, but ditches the liability. 

**Speaker 10:** And to be extra safe, they use something called small cell suppression. If there are fewer than 10 people in a very specific category, you know, left-handed banjo players in Iowa, the system just hides the data.

**Speaker 9:** So you can't accidentally identify someone just because they're unique. 

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. Anonymity is mathematically guaranteed. Hmm. 


## Network Effects: From 17 Years of Data to 17 Months

**Speaker 9:** This brings us to the bigger picture. We've got the interface, we've got the privacy strategy, but the ultimate goal here is speed. The sources talk about the network effect and they compare their mission to the work of a Dr.

James Fatman. 

**Speaker 10:** Dr. Fatman is a legend in the psychedelic underground. For years long before this stuff was mainstream or legal, he was collecting data on microdosing, 

**Speaker 9:** but not through a hospital or university. 

**Speaker 10:** No, he couldn't. It was illegal. He did it all through a website. People would self-report. I took this much, I felt this way.

He spent 17 years building that dataset. He proved two things. First, that systematic data collection works, and second, that people will participate if they feel safe and anonymous. 

**Speaker 9:** 17 years is a long time to wait for answers. 

**Speaker 10:** PPNs pitch is basically, we wanna do what Fatman did in 17 years, but in 17 months, 

**Speaker 9:** and that's where the network effect kicks in.

**Speaker 10:** It's the classic flywheel concept in week one. The platform is frankly not that useful. Maybe you have 50 patients in the system, the predictions are fuzzy. 

**Speaker 9:** The cold start problem, 

**Speaker 10:** right? But fast forward to year two. Now imagine you have 5,000 patients. The predictions become scary, accurate. The safety alerts like for that benzodiazepine interaction are potentially saving lives.

The tool becomes indispensable 

**Speaker 9:** and the more indispensable it is, the more doctors sign up 

**Speaker 10:** and the more doctors sign up, the better the data gets. It just spirals upward, 

**Speaker 9:** and once that flywheel is spinning, it's very hard for a competitor to catch up. 

**Speaker 10:** That is the defensibility. If PPN reaches 1000 distinct protocols, first they become the industry standard.

It creates a defensive advantage that lasts for a decade. It's the same playbook, 23, and Me used. 

**Speaker 9:** I remember when 23 Emmy launched, everyone thought they were a novelty gift company. You'd buy the kit for your uncle, 

**Speaker 10:** right? But 23 and E didn't make its real value selling $99 spit kits. They built a multi-billion dollar valuation because they had the largest structured database of genetic information in the world.

**Speaker 9:** The aggregation is the product 

**Speaker 10:** precisely. They sold the insights, not the kits. PPN is doing the same thing, but for clinical outcomes, 


## Business Model & Legal Positioning: $999/mo, DEA Risk, ‘Quality Improvement’

**Speaker 9:** which brings us to the business model because unlike 23 and me, this isn't a consumer product. They're selling this to clinics and the price tag mentioned the deck is.

Bold, 

**Speaker 10:** very bold. 

**Speaker 9:** $999 per site per month, 

**Speaker 10:** a thousand dollars a month. It's a lot, 

**Speaker 9:** especially when you consider that most software these doctors use for scheduling for basic notes costs maybe 50 or a hundred dollars a month. 

**Speaker 10:** It is a steep jump, but PPN argues that you aren't paying for software, you are paying for clinical decision support.

**Speaker 9:** What's the difference in value there? 

**Speaker 10:** Well, think about the cost of a bad decision. 

**Speaker 9:** Hmm. 

**Speaker 10:** If a doctor mistreats a patient because they didn't know about that drug interaction, the patient doesn't get better. The clinic loses a customer, maybe they face a lawsuit, or maybe the doctor just burns out from the stress of constantly guessing.

**Speaker 9:** So the a thousand dollars is basically an insurance policy against incompetence. 

**Speaker 10:** It's the, am I doing this right tax? This is a new field. Practitioners are anxious. They're working with powerful substances, paying a premium to have the collective brain power of the entire network guiding your hand. For a lot of them, that peace of mind is a bargain.

**Speaker 9:** It also positions them really interestingly with the law. We touched on this, but ketamine is legal. Psilocybin and MDMA are. Not so much, at least not federally. 

**Speaker 10:** And that is the other reason. The no PHI thing is so vital. If you are a company holding a list of names of people using schedule ice substances, you are painting a massive target on your back.

For the DEA, 

**Speaker 9:** they're holding a confession list 

**Speaker 10:** exactly. By collecting no identifiers. PPN avoids that federal exposure. They position the tool not as medical research, which requires FDA approval, but as. Quality improvement. 

**Speaker 9:** Quality improvement sounds like a semantic trick. 

**Speaker 10:** It's a very specific legal definition.

Quality improvement is internal benchmarking. It's allowed, it lets them start with ketamine, then move into Oregon psilocybin services and eventually into MDMA, all while staying in a safe legal harbor. 


## Endgame Vision: A Never-Ending, Real-World Decentralized Clinical Trial

**Speaker 9:** So what's the end game here? Five years down the road. Does PPN just want to be a software company? 

**Speaker 10:** I don't think so.

The vision in the deck is much bigger. They want to change how medical research is done fundamentally. 

**Speaker 9:** How so? 

**Speaker 10:** Right now, clinical trials are artificial. You recruit a hundred people, you put them in a sterile lab, you filter out anyone with complex issues and you watch 'em for a year. It's slow, it's expensive, and it doesn't really reflect the real world.

**Speaker 9:** Because in the real world, patients are messy. They have anxiety, they take other meds. 

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. PPN wants to turn every single clinical encounter in the real world into a data point. They wanna run a massive, decentralized clinical trial that never, ever ends. 

**Speaker 9:** So if I go to a clinic in Ohio on a Tuesday. My data helps a patient in London on a Friday.

**Speaker 10:** Instantly it accelerates the feedback loop from decades to days. 

**Speaker 9:** It's taking the concept of the hive mine and applying it directly to medicine. 

**Speaker 10:** And in a field like psychedelics, which is so subjective, so variable that hive mine might be the only way we ever really understand what's going on. 

**Speaker 9:** It's a fascinating shift.

We usually think that to get better healthcare, we need to get more personal. We need the doctor to know us deeply. 

**Speaker 10:** But PPN suggests the opposite approach to data, 

**Speaker 9:** right? They're suggesting that maybe the best way to advance medicine is to know less about the patient, their identity, their name, so we can understand more about the treatment 

**Speaker 10:** anonymity as the key to precision.

It's a wild thought, but the logic really does hold up. 

**Speaker 9:** It definitely gives you something to think about. 


## Wrap-Up: The Infrastructure the Psychedelic Wild West Needs

**Speaker 9:** That's a wrap on our deep dive into the PPN Research portal. It's a complex mix of tech law and pharmacology, but it might just be the infrastructure this wild west needs. Thanks for listening. 

**Speaker 10:** See you next time.

# The\_Boring\_Logistics\_of\_Psychedelic\_Breakthroughs


## Turning the Camera Around: The Therapist on the Brink

**Speaker 7:** Whenever we talk about the, uh, psychedelic renaissance, the camera is always pointed at the patient. Right. We see the breakthrough, the tears 

**Speaker 8:** face changing moment. 

**Speaker 7:** Exactly, yes. The hero shot of the whole fitness 

**Speaker 8:** group. And this sells the documentaries for sure, 

**Speaker 7:** but today we are turning that camera around 180 degrees.

We're looking at the person in the chair next to the patient. The therapist. 

**Speaker 8:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 7:** Because according to these documents we're diving into, that person isn't having a breakthrough. 

**Speaker 8:** No. They're dangerously close to having a breakdown. 

**Speaker 7:** That feels like a pretty accurate way to put it. 

**Speaker 8:** Well, we assume if the patient is getting better, the whole system must be working.

But the back end of this industry. It's, uh, it's a mess. 


## Inside the Leaked Strategy Doc: From ‘Liability Shield’ to Practice OS

**Speaker 7:** So we have our hands on this really fascinating internal strategy document. It's from the PPN research portal titled Use Cases, and it's dated just this month, February 12th, 2026. 

**Speaker 8:** And it's cross-referenced with something called Comprehensive Voice of Customer Research.

**Speaker 7:** And that voice of customer part seems to be the key. 

**Speaker 8:** Oh, absolutely. This isn't some marketing brochure. This is like a postmortem of a huge disconnect. It shows what software developers thought therapists needed, 

**Speaker 7:** right, 

**Speaker 8:** versus what those therapists were actually screaming for. Once they tried to use the tools in the real world, 

**Speaker 7:** it really feels like a clash of cultures.

You have Silicon Valley trying to build software. I don't know, modern day shamanism 

**Speaker 8:** missing the mark. At least at first, the document lays out this massive strategic pivot. The developers, they started out building what they called a liability shield. 

**Speaker 7:** So basically tools to keep you out of jail. 

**Speaker 8:** Exactly, but the therapist pushed back and said, look, we don't just need to stay outta jail.

We need to stay in business. They forced this shift to what they're now calling a practice operating system. 

**Speaker 7:** Okay, so let's get into the weeds, because these specific use cases paint such a vivid picture. 


## Fear Use Cases \#1–3: Proving Safety, Avoiding Malpractice, Surviving Compliance

**Speaker 7:** The document starts with what it calls confirmed use cases, and the first three are just, they're dripping with paranoia, 

**Speaker 8:** right?

**Speaker 7:** Use case one is literally titled, prove You're not Reckless. 

**Speaker 8:** It sounds so aggressive, doesn't it? Yeah. But you have to understand the context. Even now in 2026, there's this massive law enforcement intrusion risk. 

**Speaker 7:** Is that really still a fear though? I mean, I thought we were kind of past the whole DEA rating.

The clinic phase. 

**Speaker 8:** We aren't, not entirely. The document explicitly mentions the fear of seizure of substances. 

**Speaker 7:** Wow. 

**Speaker 8:** If you're a practitioner holding these compounds and your paperwork isn't perfect, you're not just looking at losing your license, you're looking at potential felonies. 

**Speaker 7:** So the software was built for that fear.

It mentions a safety risk matrix. Sounds like something from a nuclear plant. 

**Speaker 8:** It's a proactive as assessment tool. So the developers thought, okay, well give them a tool to predict risk. And they offered safety surveillance for real-time monitoring, 

**Speaker 7:** but that wasn't enough. 

**Speaker 8:** No, because here's where the voice of customer comes in.

The therapist said, great. You're monitoring safety, but I need to prove it. 

**Speaker 7:** What's the distinction? 

**Speaker 8:** Data. The therapist demanded screening completion flags and vital sign monitoring. Think about it. If a patient has a panic attack to a regulator, that looks like a bad trip 

**Speaker 7:** or reckless endangerment, 

**Speaker 8:** right?

But if you have a timestamped log showing, you check their blood pressure every 30 minutes, followed protocol, it becomes a managed adverse event. 

**Speaker 7:** One is a drug party, the other is a medical procedure 

**Speaker 8:** precisely, and that data protects you from the second big fear use case too. Reduce malpractice exposure.

**Speaker 7:** The document calls this, the background radiation of the industry. 

**Speaker 8:** Such a great phrase. It's this low level toxicity that's just always there. Always buzzing 

**Speaker 7:** the anxiety of the unknown. 

**Speaker 8:** Totally. We don't have 50 years of case law for this. If someone sues you because they had a terrifying experience, what's the standard of care?

How do you prove you did it right? 


## Dynamic Consent & ‘Ontological Shock’: Why Standard Forms Fail

**Speaker 7:** Which leads to maybe the most fascinating term in this whole document for me. They talk about informed consent, which is standard. 

**Speaker 8:** Yeah, that's normal. 

**Speaker 7:** But then they bring up ontological shock. 

**Speaker 8:** This is what's unique to psychedelics. You don't get ontological shock from like a knee surgery, 

**Speaker 7:** right?

So what is it? 

**Speaker 8:** It's when your fundamental worldview, your understanding of what's real, who you are, is just shattered. 

**Speaker 7:** How do you sign a waiver for that? I agree. I might realize I'm one with the universe and my accounting job is meaningless and I won't sue. 

**Speaker 8:** You've just hit the legal paradox. Can you truly consent to something that's literally ineffable, you know, impossible to describe?

**Speaker 7:** So a standard form fails 

**Speaker 8:** completely. You can't just sign a PDF at intake and call it good. That's why the document proposes a dynamic consent engine. 

**Speaker 7:** Which sounds like a buzzword. 

**Speaker 8:** It does, but it addresses a really practical problem. Touch, 

**Speaker 7:** touch, consent. 

**Speaker 8:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 7:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 8:** In talk therapy, you rarely touch a patient here.

A hand on the shoulder can be incredibly grounding, but it can also be misinterpreted, especially in an altered state, 

**Speaker 7:** and you can't just stop the session and say. Hey, can you sign this addendum? 

**Speaker 8:** Right? So this engine lets you set up protocols beforehand. What's okay, what isn't? But it also tracks consent during the session.

It makes consent, a continuous process, not a one-time signature. 

**Speaker 7:** Okay, that makes sense. It protects everyone. Let's round out the fear section, then use case three. Comply with state regulations. 

**Speaker 8:** The regulatory void, as they call it. 

**Speaker 7:** The document says regulations are changing monthly and practitioners are spending 10 to 15 hours a month just on paperwork.

**Speaker 8:** Think about that. That's two full work days a month just on compliance. That's revenue lost, patient time lost. 

**Speaker 7:** It's like they need a TurboTax for psychedelic therapy. 

**Speaker 8:** That's a great analogy. You mess up your taxes, you pay a fine, you mess up these forms, you get shut down. But this is where the pivot happens 

**Speaker 7:** because the developers thought this was it.

**Speaker 8:** They thought these three things, safety, malpractice, compliance, where the whole product make them safe, they'll buy it. 

**Speaker 7:** But the therapist said, that's n, but I'm going broke. 

**Speaker 8:** And that brings us to section two. 


## Chaos Use Case \#4: Insurance Reimbursement, CPT Codes, and Getting Paid

**Speaker 8:** The chaos use cases, this is where the rubber meets the road 

**Speaker 7:** use case four is get reimbursement approved and the document is brutally honest.

Here it says the industry's view on insurance was too optimistic, 

**Speaker 8:** which is corporate speak for insurers are rejecting everything and nobody's getting paid. 

**Speaker 7:** I'm seeing a lot of jargon here. CPT codes 0 2 0 T versus 9 0 8 3 7. Why does this matter to our listeners? 

**Speaker 8:** It matters because these codes determine if this therapy is just for the wealthy or for everyone.

9 0 8 3 7 is the code for a standard 60 minute therapy session. It's safe Insurers know it. Okay. 0 8 2 0 T is a new temporary code just for psychedelic monitoring. The problem is insurers don't recognize it or they pay a tiny rate. So therapists are trying to cram these six hour sessions into the old codes, which triggers audits.

**Speaker 7:** It's a game of chicken with the insurance companies 

**Speaker 8:** and the therapists are losing. They're begging for billing cheat sheets. They need the software to generate what's called real world evidence or R-W-E-R-W-E data that proves that therapy works. Insurers are saying, you want me to pay for 12 hours of time, show me the data that this patient actually got better 

**Speaker 7:** and their current software can't do that.


## The Biggest Pain Point: Workflow Failure and the ‘Frankenstein Stack’

**Speaker 7:** Which brings us to the biggest revelation in the whole document. Use case six, solve the Workflow failure. 

**Speaker 8:** This was the number one pain point from the voice of customer research. The developers looked at what tools therapists are actually using, and it's a complete disaster. 

**Speaker 7:** I have the list here and it is both hilarious and terrifying.

Intake queue for forms. Spruce for messaging. Spotify, consumer, Spotify for music, 

**Speaker 8:** a Frankenstein stack 

**Speaker 7:** and Excel for outcomes, plus a generic EHR like simple practice. 

**Speaker 8:** And none of these tools talk to each other, so you're toggling between five different tabs while trying to hold space for someone's deepest trauma.

It's insane. 

**Speaker 7:** Why can't they just use one of the big hospital EHRs like Epic? 

**Speaker 8:** Because those systems are built for the 15 minute encounter. You check a throat type a few notes, you're done. Psychedelic therapy is a six to eight hour continuous event. 

**Speaker 7:** So if you're using Epic, 

**Speaker 8:** you'd have to leave the chart open for eight hours and there's no button for.

Patient is weeping about childhood trauma. There's no field for music transition to ambient track. 

**Speaker 7:** The document calls this the session logger gap. 


## Tap-to-Log Sessions \+ Automated Outcomes: Building Real-World Evidence

**Speaker 8:** This is where the therapist really reshaped the product. They didn't want more dropdown menus. They wanted a digital clinical container. 

**Speaker 7:** They call it tap to log, 

**Speaker 8:** right?

Imagine an iPad on the therapist's lap. Dark mode, so it's not distracting. Just big, simple buttons, distress, breakthrough, vital check. Restroom. 

**Speaker 7:** So the therapist isn't typing. They're just tapping 

**Speaker 8:** exactly. It keeps them present. The click clack of a keyboard is so bureaucratic, it can pull a patient right out of a deep state.

A silent tap captures the data you need for that defensible documentation 

**Speaker 7:** without breaking the connection. It seems so simple, 

**Speaker 8:** but it solves admin burnout. If you don't have to spend two hours after a six hour session typing notes from memory, you can actually go home when the patient does, 

**Speaker 7:** and it also captures the outcome data.

It mentions automated MBC measurement based care. 

**Speaker 8:** Right now that's done in Excel. If at all, this system automates sending out questionnaires like the MEQ 30, the Mystical Experience Questionnaire. 

**Speaker 7:** Wait, that's a real medical scale. 

**Speaker 8:** It is. It measures things like ineffability and transcendence of time and space.

Try putting that into a standard medical chart next to cholesterol levels. 

**Speaker 7:** Patient reported transcendence of time and space prescribed ibuprofen. 

**Speaker 8:** You get it. The system has to be native to the experience, and if you automate that data, you finally get the real world evidence you need to make the insurance companies pay.


## Human Use Cases: Supervision, Mentorship, and a Safety Net for Healers

**Speaker 7:** So we've covered fear and chaos. There's a third section here that feels softer, but maybe more critical. The human use cases. 

**Speaker 8:** Use case seven. Find peer supervision and mentorship. 

**Speaker 7:** The document talks about a post-training cliff. What's that? 

**Speaker 8:** It's a huge issue. You pay say, $10,000 for certification program.

You learn the theory, then you graduate, rent an office, and suddenly you are completely alone. 

**Speaker 7:** Alone wolf. 

**Speaker 8:** In this field, being alone is dangerous. We're not just talking about difficult clients. The document lists, spiritual emergencies, intense countertransference, and even erotic transference. 

**Speaker 7:** Okay, let's unpack spiritual emergency.

Yeah, that sounds dramatic. 

**Speaker 8:** It is, and it's very real. A client might become convinced they're a prophet or that they're dying. If you're a junior therapist alone in a room with that kind of energy, it's terrifying 

**Speaker 7:** and you can't just call 9 1 1. 

**Speaker 8:** No. That often makes it worse. Police aren't trained for this.

You need a wise elder. 

**Speaker 7:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 8:** You need someone with 20 years of experience to say, I've seen this. Breathe. Here's what you do. 

**Speaker 7:** But those networks don't really exist. 

**Speaker 8:** It's a supervision desert. So this new practice operating system includes a supervision exchange. It's basically matchmaking for therapists 

**Speaker 7:** like diet matching in circles.

**Speaker 8:** Yeah, it's digitizing the old apprenticeship model. It. Learn how to handle this stuff by debriefing with people who've sat through hundreds of these sessions. The document even mentions a directory of verified elders. 

**Speaker 7:** I love that they use that term elders. It's not just clinical. 

**Speaker 8:** It bridges the shamonic and the clinical traditions.

It creates a safety net for the healer, 

**Speaker 7:** which brings us to the final piece of the puzzle. 


## Integration That Sticks: Neuroplasticity Windows, Homework, and Retention

**Speaker 7:** Use case eight, standardize integration protocols. 

**Speaker 8:** This is the bridge back to reality. 

**Speaker 7:** The document says integration collides without patient economics. Why is talking about the trip so much harder to sell than the trip itself?

**Speaker 8:** Because the dosing session, the trip, that's the fireworks. It's the high ticket item. Clients feel like they're paying for the drug. The experience integration just looks like more talk therapy, 

**Speaker 7:** so they just skip it. 

**Speaker 8:** High client churn the document, calls it, they have the breakthrough. They feel great for a few days, that afterglow, and then they just ghost the therapist 

**Speaker 7:** and then they crash.

**Speaker 8:** Without that psychological scaffolding, yes, old habits come back. The epiphany fades. 

**Speaker 7:** I saw the term neuroplasticity windows. 

**Speaker 8:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 7:** Of the solution here. 

**Speaker 8:** This is the science of why integration matters. After a dose, the brain is hyperplastic for a few weeks. It's malleable. You can rewrite habits and trauma responses much more easily.

**Speaker 7:** It's a biological window of opportunity. 

**Speaker 8:** Exactly. And the software wants to track that. It wants to send homework and exercises time specifically to that window, 

**Speaker 7:** so your phone buzzes you and says, Hey, your brain is primed for change right now. Do this journaling exercise. 

**Speaker 8:** Yes, it shifts the value from come in for a chat to let's maximize your neuroplasticity.

It makes patients more likely to stick with it, 

**Speaker 7:** and for the business that stabilizes revenue, 

**Speaker 8:** sustain remission for the patient, sustain revenue for the clinic. It aligns the incentives. 


## Conclusion: The Real Bottleneck Is the Boring Delivery System

**Speaker 7:** So when we step back and look at this entire pivot. It's a story about the industry growing up. 

**Speaker 8:** It is the old hero message was defensible documentation.

It was fear-based, don't get sued, 

**Speaker 7:** and the new message is the practice operating system, 

**Speaker 8:** which is function-based. Here's how you actually do the work. 

**Speaker 7:** It just strikes me that we spend so much time debating. The molecules is MDMA approved is psilocin decriminalized, but this suggests that even if you legalized everything tomorrow, the system would collapse.

**Speaker 8:** The molecules are the easy part. I mean, nature gave us those. The science is largely done. The real bottleneck is the delivery system. 

**Speaker 7:** The delivery system being all the boring stuff. 

**Speaker 8:** The boring stuff is the most important stuff. If you can't bill for it, if you can't insure it, if your therapists burn out after two years because the workflow is a nightmare.

**Speaker 7:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 8:** Then this never scale. 

**Speaker 7:** It just stays a boutique luxury for rich people in Malibu. 

**Speaker 8:** And that's not a revolution, that's a retreat center. A revolution requires scale. Mm-hmm. And scale requires boring. Things like CPT code optimization and efficient session logging. 

**Speaker 7:** So the revolution isn't just about expanding consciousness.

It's about expanding administrative capacity. 

**Speaker 8:** It's almost funny, isn't it? CPT codes, tap to log interfaces and liability insurance. That's how you heal the world. You make the miraculous, boring enough to be scalable, 

**Speaker 7:** make the miraculous boring. I think that's the perfect place to leave it. 

**Speaker 8:** Well, I think so too 

**Speaker 7:** to our listener.

Next time you read a headline about a psychedelic breakthrough, maybe ask yourself, who is holding the iPad and is the battery charged? Thanks for diving in with us. 

**Speaker 8:** See you next time.

## The Shiny Psychedelic Boom vs. the Messy Reality

**Speaker 13:** Welcome back to the deep dive. I want you to picture something for me. You open your newsfeed and what do you see when it comes to mental health these days? 

**Speaker 14:** You see the shiny stuff. 

**Speaker 13:** The shiny stuff, exactly. Yeah. You see the shroom boom, you see venture capitalists, you know, pouring millions into psychedelic startups.

You see these glossy magazine covers talking about how magic mushrooms are going to cure depression, 

**Speaker 14:** right? And you see these. Pristine, almost futuristic looking clinics. Yeah. You know, in Manhattan or LA with the white walls and the expensive recliners and the IV drips. 

**Speaker 13:** Yes. It looks like a victory lap.

It looks like the industry has already arrived. Like it's clean, it's medical, and it's all ready for prime time. 

**Speaker 14:** It looks sanitized. 

**Speaker 13:** Sanitized. That's the perfect word. It looks like medicine. But today we are going to completely dismantle that image. We're looking at a stack of documents that reveal the actual reality of this so-called psychedelic renaissance.

And lemme tell you, it is not shiny. 

**Speaker 14:** No, it's, it's messy. It's really dangerous. And for the most part, it's all happening in the dark. 

**Speaker 13:** The Wild West is the term that keeps coming up over and over in this research. And it's not an exaggeration at all. 

**Speaker 14:** Not in the slightest, it's a chaotic frontier. 


## Meet the PPN Portal: A “Calendar App” That’s Actually a Trojan Horse

**Speaker 13:** We're talking about the underground, we're talking about the gray market, and specifically we are gonna do a deep dive into this.

Fascinating, and I'd say somewhat secretive projects called the PPN Portal. That's the Psychedelic Practitioners Network. 

**Speaker 14:** Right, and if you just glanced at the brochure for it, you'd think it's a boring piece of software. 

**Speaker 13:** Totally. It looks like a calendar app for therapists, something to book appointments, maybe send an invoice.

Super simple. 

**Speaker 14:** But when you actually dig into the architecture and the encryption protocols and the business logic, which we have done, you realize this is not a calendar. 

**Speaker 13:** Not even close. The documents we have describe it explicitly as a Trojan horse, 

**Speaker 14:** and that is the single most important concept to grasp here.

The Trojan horse. 

**Speaker 13:** Mm-hmm. '


## The Core Disconnect: Illegal Drugs, Massive Demand, and “Dark Data”

**Speaker 14:** cause the central problem, this whole document stack identifies, is this massive disconnect in modern mental health. 

**Speaker 13:** Okay. Break that down. 

**Speaker 14:** Well, on one side you have the law. The law says these substances, psilocybin, M-D-M-A-L-S-D are largely illegal. They're schedule a drugs. 

**Speaker 13:** Right?

The most dangerous category officially. Yeah. 

**Speaker 14:** But then on the other side, you have this immense demand. You have millions of people who are desperately seeking healing for things that. Frankly, traditional psychiatry just hasn't been able to fix for them. 

**Speaker 13:** And who's bridging that gap? 

**Speaker 14:** Thousands of practitioners, guides, sitters, underground therapists, people operating out of basements and living rooms and yurts.

And they are bridging that gap between the law and the demand. 

**Speaker 13:** And they are terrified. 

**Speaker 14:** They are petrified. And here's the real kicker, these people. These illegal operators, they're currently sitting on the largest data set in the entire history of mental health. 

**Speaker 13:** Wow. Say more about that. 

**Speaker 14:** I mean, they're overseeing tens of thousands of high dose sessions for incredibly difficult conditions.

**Speaker 13:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 14:** PTSD, treatment resistant depression, severe addiction, but because they're hiding from the law. All of that data is invisible. It's what we call dark data. It's completely unmeasured. 

**Speaker 13:** So the entire premise of this PPM portal is how do we trick, or maybe incentivize is a better word, a bunch of paranoid underground drug facilitators to start uploading all their data into a centralized system.

**Speaker 14:** Exactly. How do you digitize a black market without getting everybody arrested? That's the fundamental engineering challenge here, 

**Speaker 13:** and the answer seems to involve some pretty wild stuff. 


## Inside the Trench Coat: What PPN Promises to Unpack

**Speaker 13:** Dual use technology, military grade encryption. 

**Speaker 14:** In a business model that is, and this is my favorite description from the documents, five different companies wearing a trench coat.

**Speaker 13:** I love that image. Five companies in a trench coat. We are gonna break down every single layer of that coat. Today we're gonna look at the voice of customer research that exposes just how broken the current system is. 

**Speaker 14:** Yeah, the pain is palpable. 

**Speaker 13:** We're gonna look at the Phantom Shield technology, which includes these incredible things like blind vetting and crisis loggers.

And we're gonna ask the big question, is this whole thing actually about safety or is it just about packaging up that data and selling it to big farmer? 

**Speaker 14:** The billion dollar question, is this thing a shield or is it a snare? 


## VOC Research: Practitioners Are Drowning in Workflow Chaos

**Speaker 13:** So let's start where all good product design starts. The documents kick off with this really expensive voice of customer or VOC research, and I have to say, this isn't your standard.

I wish the button was blue, kind of feedback. 

**Speaker 14:** No, it reads like a distress signal. It's visceral. 

**Speaker 13:** It really is. The researchers interviewed practitioners from both sides of the aisle. You have the licensed side, you know the legal ketamine clinics, and then you have the completely underground side, the mushroom guides, and the picture that emerges is of a workforce that is just.

Drowning. 

**Speaker 14:** They identify a massive workflow failure. That's the core of it. 

**Speaker 13:** So to understand this failure, you really have to understand the complexity of the job itself. 

**Speaker 14:** Absolutely. If you're a standard talk therapist, your workflow is, well, it's predictable. A client comes in, they sit for 50 minutes, you talk, they leave.

You write a short paragraph of notes in your electronic health record, your EHR. You're done. 

**Speaker 13:** Clean, simple, billable. 

**Speaker 14:** Exactly. But a psychedelic session, that's a six to eight hour ordeal. It's a marathon. 

**Speaker 13:** It's a whole different animal, a 

**Speaker 14:** whole different one. It involves extensive medical screening beforehand.

Then there's the whole preparation phase, then the actual dosing session, which has this huge variability. You never know what's gonna happen. And then crucially, the integration work afterwards. 

**Speaker 13:** And right now the stack or the toolkit these people are using to manage all that complexity is. Well, the research says it's basically a joke.

**Speaker 14:** It is. I was looking at the list of tools they're using. It's like a patchwork quilt of total dysfunction. 

**Speaker 13:** So what are they using? 

**Speaker 14:** They've got something like IntakeQ for the digital forms because it's, uh, ipi compliant, which is good, but then they're using spruce or signal for encrypted messaging because they're paranoid about surveillance.

**Speaker 13:** Understandably so, 

**Speaker 14:** of course. And then they've got these clunky Excel spreadsheets to track outcomes, which, you know, usually break or the data gets corrupted. They're managing the all important music on Spotify playlists, and then maybe they're using something like Simple Practice for the billing, 

**Speaker 13:** and none of these things talk to each other, 

**Speaker 14:** not a single one.

So you have a practitioner who is, for all intents and purposes a healthcare provider, but they're spending what, 40% of their time just acting as an IT system administrator. 

**Speaker 13:** Just copy pasting data from Signal into Excel. From Excel into IntakeQ. It's madness. 

**Speaker 14:** It's what the documents call administrative burnout.

But it's not just annoying. The research highlights a much deeper danger here. 


## Why Measurement-Based Care Breaks in Psychedelic Sessions

**Speaker 14:** This fragmentation, it leads to a void in what we call measurement-based care. 

**Speaker 13:** Okay, break that down for us. What is measurement-based care in this specific context, and why is it failing so badly? 

**Speaker 14:** In standard medicine, it's simple.

If you have high blood pressure, we measure it. We give you a pill, we measure it again a month later, we know if it worked, 

**Speaker 13:** we have a number. It goes up or it goes down 

**Speaker 14:** exactly. In psychedelic therapy, because the tools are so bad, nobody's measuring anything consistently. You can't just use a standard electronic health record in EHR for this kind of work.

**Speaker 13:** Why not? Why can't I just use Epic or whatever my family doctor uses? 

**Speaker 14:** Because those systems are built for the 15 minute visit. They're glorified billing machines. Mm-hmm. You go in sore throat, click. Prescribed to antibiotics, click goodbye. That's the model. 

**Speaker 13:** And a psychedelic session is the opposite of that.

**Speaker 14:** It's a narrative arc. It's a story. You need to know what happened at hour two when the patient started crying about their mother. You need to know what happened at hour six when their blood pressure spiked for a few minutes. You need to track the music cues. Trying to document all of that in a standard medical chart is like.

Like trying to write a novel on a sticky note. 

**Speaker 13:** It just doesn't fit the medium at all. 

**Speaker 14:** It doesn't fit. So what's the result? The research shows that practitioners just stop taking good notes or they keep them on paper, which is a huge security risk. And as we're gonna discuss later. Paper notes, or even worse, no notes is a legal death sentence if something goes wrong.


## The Lone Wolf Crisis: Certification Without Supervision

**Speaker 13:** Which brings us to the second circle of hell identified in this research. The isolation, they call it the lone wolf crisis. 

**Speaker 14:** This is the part that frankly, it scares me the most. We're seeing this phenomenon that the researchers call the certification. 

**Speaker 13:** And this is about the training programs, right? The ones that are popping up everywhere, 

**Speaker 14:** right?

So you have this explosion of interest. People are paying five, $10,000 to get certified in psychedelic therapy. They take a weekend course or maybe a six month online program. They learn the history, the theory, the pharmacology. They feel confident, they feel great, 

**Speaker 13:** and then the course ends 

**Speaker 14:** and they are kicked outta the nest.

They're just released into the wild. And suddenly it's a Tuesday night, they're in a room with a client who has just taken four grams of psilocybin and that client is screaming, 

**Speaker 13:** oh wow. 

**Speaker 14:** Or they're reliving a childhood assault in vivid detail. Or they're having what's known as a spiritual emergency where their entire sense of reality is collapsing 

**Speaker 13:** and there's no supervisor in the next room to call for help.

There's no attending physician to page, 

**Speaker 14:** there is no one. In traditional clinical psychology, you have supervision, you have a residency, you have a mentor. You review cases with every single week. It's built in, in the underground, or even in many of these independent ketamine clinics. That infrastructure just doesn't exist.

You are a lone wolf. 

**Speaker 13:** The documents use the phrase supervision desert. 

**Speaker 14:** It's very apt metaphor. What happens when you're in a desert for too long? You start hallucinating. Not literally maybe, but your decision making degrades. 

**Speaker 13:** You lose your bearings. 

**Speaker 14:** You lose your bearings. When you're that isolated, you are forced to rely entirely on your own intuition.

You don't have a feedback loop. You don't have a peer saying, Hey, maybe you shouldn't have done that, or Have you considered this approach? This isolation creates this pressure cooker of anxiety. 

**Speaker 13:** That anxiety seems to center on one thing above all else. We saw this in the voice of customer survey responses.

The number one fear across the board wasn't bad trips or losing money. 

**Speaker 14:** Nope. It was liability. 

**Speaker 13:** This sort of damocles just hanging over their heads. 

**Speaker 14:** What documentation protects me? What documentation puts me in jail. That is the question that is haunting every single one of these people, 

**Speaker 13:** and it's a terrifying double bind.


## Liability Terror: Criminal vs. Civil Risk and the Record-Keeping Trap

**Speaker 13:** This is where the Wild West reality just crashes head on into the legal system. 

**Speaker 14:** It really does. Let's look at the two types of practitioners. The research identifies first, you have the underground operator. Maybe they're working under a religious exemption, maybe they're just totally illicit. Their biggest fear is criminal liability.

**Speaker 13:** The EA kicking down the door. 

**Speaker 14:** Exactly. Raids. Warrants federal prison. 

**Speaker 13:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 14:** So their instinct, their survival strategy up to this point has been a. Write nothing down, 

**Speaker 13:** right? If there's no paper trail, there's no crime. That's the logic. 

**Speaker 14:** That's the logic. 

**Speaker 13:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 14:** Keep no records use disappearing messages, cash only.

But then you have the other side of the coin, the licensed side. The Ketamine clinics, they're terrified of civil liability 

**Speaker 13:** malpractice suits. Insurance audits. 

**Speaker 14:** They wanna document everything they need, what the documents call audit, ready documentation to prove they weren't being negligent. 

**Speaker 13:** Okay, so you have two groups with totally opposite incentives for record keeping.

**Speaker 14:** You'd think so, but here is the catch. And the PPN documents make this point brilliantly, even for the underground. The no record strategy is actually a trap. 

**Speaker 13:** Wait, explain that. If I'm a mushroom guide, surely having a file on my laptop labeled John doe's illegal drug session is a terrible idea. Why would I ever write that down?

**Speaker 14:** It feels incredibly counterintuitive. I know. But imagine this scenario. You're a guide. You give a client mushrooms. They have an unforeseen medical emergency, maybe a seizure. 

**Speaker 13:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 14:** Or maybe they get agitated and run out into traffic. 

**Speaker 13:** The absolute nightmare scenario. 

**Speaker 14:** The nightmare scenario. The ambulance comes, the police come.

Now you are in court. And the prosecutor is standing in front of a jury. 

**Speaker 13:** Okay. 

**Speaker 14:** If you have zero records, what do you look like? 

**Speaker 13:** You look like a drug dealer. 

**Speaker 14:** You look like a drug dealer. You look like a reckless amateur who just handed out a bag of drugs in your basement and hoped for the best. 

**Speaker 13:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 14:** That is the definition of negligence.

That gets you the maximum sentence. It proves you had no control, no process, no standard of care. 

**Speaker 13:** You have no proof that you screen them or check their medications or monitored their safety during the session. 

**Speaker 14:** Precisely, but if you can produce a secure, encrypted timestamped record that says, I screened this patient for all known cardiovascular and psychiatric contraindications.

I calculated the dose based on their body weight and the known potency of the batch. I monitored their vital signs every 30 minutes. I followed a documented safety protocol. 

**Speaker 13:** Even if the act itself was technically illegal, you are proving your intent to care. 

**Speaker 14:** You are distinguishing yourself from a dealer.

You are fundamentally shifting the narrative from drug distribution to unlicensed medical practice. And in the eyes of a jury. That is a massive, massive difference. 

**Speaker 13:** One is a major felony drug charge. The other might be a much lesser licensing violation. 

**Speaker 14:** It could be the difference between 20 years in prison and probation.

So the whole PPN strategy is to convince the underground that they need to reframe their thinking. They need to move from record keeping, which sounds like creating evidence of a crime to audit defense. 

**Speaker 13:** Audit defense. I like that. It's a powerful reframe, 

**Speaker 14:** but you can't just ask people to start typing descriptions of felonies into a normal database.

If I'm an underground guide, I'm not putting my client notes into Google Docs or Evernote. 

**Speaker 13:** No way. You'd have to be insane. 


## Phantom Shield Begins: Trading Legal/Safety Defense for Anonymized Data

**Speaker 14:** So you need a special kind of shield. 

**Speaker 13:** And that brings us to the Phantom Shield. This is the part of the tech act that is designed specifically for this gray market. How do you get these people who are fundamentally paranoid for good reason?

To use the software, 

**Speaker 14:** you have to offer them something more valuable than their fear. You have to make trade. You trade them legal and safety defense in exchange for their anonymized data. And the PPM platform does this using what they call dual use technology. 

**Speaker 13:** Okay? What does that mean 

**Speaker 14:** to the user, the practitioner?

It looks and feels like a safety tool, a shield, but to the network to PPN, it's a data aggregator, a vacuum. 

**Speaker 13:** Let's look at one of the coolest features here. 


## Blind Vetting Explained: Hashing, Salt, and the Underground Blacklist

**Speaker 13:** Blind vetting. This solves a huge, huge problem in the underground. How do you know your new client isn't an undercover cop or a violent stalker, or just someone who is gonna sue you for everything you have?

**Speaker 14:** Yeah. Right now they rely on what they call whisper networks. You ask a friend, Hey, I got a call from this guy, Bob, is he cool? 

**Speaker 13:** Which just sounds incredibly inefficient and unreliable. 

**Speaker 14:** It's terribly inefficient and it's deeply biased. It relies on social capital. If you're new to town or you're not in the ingroup.

You don't have access to the whisper network, so you're flying blind. 

**Speaker 13:** So how does PPN solve this with technology? 

**Speaker 14:** It's a system called Blind Hashing. This is technology that's been borrowed from the most privacy obsessed corners of the internet, like cryptocurrency and secure messengers like signal. 

**Speaker 13:** So walk us through the user experience.

I'm a guide, a new potential client. Let's call him. Bob texts me for the first time. What happens next? 

**Speaker 14:** You take Bob's phone number and you punch it into the PPN app on your phone. The app instantly hashes it. 

**Speaker 13:** Okay, what is hashing? 

**Speaker 14:** Think of a hash, like a digital fretter or a blender. It takes the phone number and turns it into a long, unique string of random characters.

It looks gibberish and crucially, it adds salt. 

**Speaker 13:** Salt, like table salt. What's that for? 

**Speaker 14:** In cryptography, salt is just a piece of random data that gets added to the mix before you blend it. It means that even if someone stole the entire database of hashes, they couldn't use a rainbow table to reverse engineer the original phone number.

**Speaker 13:** It's an extra layer of security, 

**Speaker 14:** a critical one. If you blend a strawberry with some random salt, you can't turn that smoothie back into the original strawberry. That's salted hash. The key is the PPN server never sees Bob's real phone number. 

**Speaker 13:** Hmm. 

**Speaker 14:** It only ever sees the gibberish string. 

**Speaker 13:** So the server has absolutely no idea who Bob is or what his number is.

**Speaker 14:** Correct. But, and this is the magic, it can compare that unique string of gibberish against a blacklist of other strings of gibberish that had been flagged by other practitioners in the network. 

**Speaker 13:** Ah, okay. I see. 


## Blind Vetting: Flagging Bad Actors Without Sharing PII

**Speaker 13:** So if a different guy to New York had a really bad experience with Bob, maybe Bob assaulted them or refused to pay, or was threatening and unstable, they flagged Bob's hash in the system.

**Speaker 14:** Exactly. They flagged the hash as a bad actor. So when you, the guide in organ. 3000 miles away type in Bob's number. The system creates the exact same hash. It checks the database, it sees the match with the bad actor tag, and it flashes a big warning on your screen. High risk safety incident reported. 

**Speaker 13:** Wow.

So you get the warning, but the system never actually had to learn Bob's name or phone number. That is incredibly clever. 

**Speaker 14:** It's what the documents call community immunity without ever sharing personally identifiable information or PII. It allows the underground to police itself. It keeps the predators out without creating a big, juicy list of names for the DEA to seize raid.

**Speaker 13:** That's amazing. It's using advanced tech to solve a very human social problem. 


## Potency Normalizer: Turning Mushroom Dosing Guesswork Into Math

**Speaker 13:** But let's look at a physical problem. The potency normalizer. This addresses a huge safety issue that I have to admit I hadn't even thought about. 

**Speaker 14:** This is absolutely critical In a pharmacy, 10 milligrams of Prozac is always 10 milligrams of Prozac.

There's quality control, 

**Speaker 13:** right? It's standardized. 

**Speaker 14:** In the underground, the phrase three grams of mushrooms is an almost meaningless statement 

**Speaker 13:** because it's a natural product, it's biology. 

**Speaker 14:** Because biology varies wildly. One batch of mushrooms grown in slightly different conditions can be two or three times stronger than another.

Batch, a strain that's nicknamed Penis Envy is known to be significantly more potent than a more common strain like golden teachers. This variance is the number one cause of what we call accidental high dose events, 

**Speaker 13:** which leads to panic attacks, which leads to 

**Speaker 14:** 9 1 1 calls, 

**Speaker 13:** right 

**Speaker 14:** and 9 1 1 calls are the number one way underground practitioners get arrested.

It's not because the police are doing some big surveillance operation. It's because your client freaked out, ran naked down the street, and a neighbor called the cops. 

**Speaker 13:** So how does a piece of software fix biology? 

**Speaker 14:** It's a dynamic dosage calculator. You the practitioner input the strain of the mushroom, the batch data if you have it, maybe even the harvest date.

The app then cross references this with a growing database of test results and user reports, 

**Speaker 13:** and it calculates the effective dose 

**Speaker 14:** precisely. So if you type in three grams of penis envy, it might flash a warning that says, whoa, based on our data, that's effectively like taking six grams of a standard mushroom.

We recommend you adjust your dose. 

**Speaker 13:** It turns guessing into math, into harm reduction. 

**Speaker 14:** Exactly. And again, going back to our legal defense strategy, if you do end up in court after an incident, you can show the judge. Look, your Honor, I wasn't just handing out bags of drugs recklessly. I was using a validated calculation tool to ensure a safe dosage based on known potency.

**Speaker 13:** It proves a standard of care. It's all about building that defensible paper trail of responsibility. 

**Speaker 14:** Every feature is designed around that principle, 


## Crisis Logger ‘Cockpit Mode’: Stress-Proof Documentation for Court

**Speaker 13:** which leaves to the crisis logger. This is the feature that felt most like something out of a sci-fi movie to me. The documents describe a cockpit mode.

**Speaker 14:** Yeah, this was designed based on the physiology of stress. It's brilliant when a patient starts spiraling, maybe they are screaming, maybe they're completely dissociated and unresponsive. The practitioner is stressed too. 

**Speaker 13:** Of course, their fight or flight is kicking in. 

**Speaker 14:** Their cortisol spikes, their fine motor skills degrade.

They suffer from tunnel vision. It's a real biological response, so you can't expect them to calmly open a laptop, log in and type a detailed paragraph like. Patient is currently experiencing psychological distress, 

**Speaker 13:** right? Your fingers would be shaking. You wouldn't be able to type 

**Speaker 14:** exactly, but if you don't document what you did during that crisis, you are legally defenseless.

Later, the prosecutor will say, what did you do for those 20 minutes? Nothing. So PPN created the crisis log. 

**Speaker 13:** And it's a simplified interface, 

**Speaker 14:** very simplified. It's an interface with massive high contrast buttons designed for high stress, low-light environments, like a pilot's cockpit in an emergency. 

**Speaker 13:** And what do the buttons say?

**Speaker 14:** Very simple. Clear actions, things like vital signs, normal verbal support provided, offered water administered chemical intervention like a Xanax called Emergency services. You just tap them as you do them, 

**Speaker 13:** and the system creates a log in the background. 

**Speaker 14:** It creates a forensic timestamp trail. 10.0 2:00 PM Distress noted.

10.0 5:00 PM Verbal deescalation started 10.2 F from pm. Trip killer administered 10.4 5:00 PM Patient, stable and responsive. 

**Speaker 13:** It proves you didn't abandon the patient. You are actively managing the situation. 

**Speaker 14:** It proves duty of care in a courtroom. That simple timestamped log is the difference between. I panicked and didn't know what to do, and I followed a standard documented safety protocol.

It transforms a chaotic, terrifying event into a managed clinical event. 


## “Five Models in a Trench Coat”: How PPN Actually Makes Money

**Speaker 13:** It's incredible how much thought has gone into protecting the practitioner here, but let's zoom out. PPN isn't a non-profit. They aren't building all this just to keep people out of jail. How does this thing actually make money?

Because looking at the business models, this is where it gets really complex. 

**Speaker 14:** It gets really, really savvy. It's not just one business, it's an ecosystem. And this is where we get that great line. The five models in a trench coat, 

**Speaker 13:** five models in a trench coat. Okay. Let's unzip the coat. What's model number one?


## Model 1 \+ 2: Clinic Commander SaaS & the Insurance Switching-Cost Lock

**Speaker 14:** Model one is called clinic commander. 

**Speaker 13:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 14:** This is the straightforward B2B SaaS play, 

**Speaker 13:** so software as a service. 

**Speaker 14:** Right. This is the wedge. It's the nice clean dashboard we've been talking about, sold to the legal clinics. It solves that immediate administrative burnout we discussed earlier. They charge, say 500, $2,000 per location per month.

**Speaker 13:** It's a high probability, fast way to get revenue in the door. It keeps the lights 

**Speaker 14:** on. Yeah, it keeps the lights on. It pays the engineers. But honestly, in the grand scheme of things, it's just the funding mechanism. It's a loss leader to pay for the development of the real asset. 

**Speaker 13:** Which brings us to model two, the risk management engine.

The documents describe this as 

**Speaker 14:** intech, and I would call this the retention lock. It's what keeps people on the platform. P. PN plans to partner with insurance carriers to offer group malpractice insurance to its members. 

**Speaker 13:** Okay. That's a huge benefit. 

**Speaker 14:** It's massive, huh? But here's the catch. You can only get access to this specially negotiated insurance if you are a verified member of the network who is actively using the PPN safety protocols.

**Speaker 13:** Ah. So if you decide to leave the software, you lose your insurance. 

**Speaker 14:** Exactly. It creates enormous switching costs. You can't just switch to a cheaper calendar app if that app doesn't come with your liability shield. But it also solves the number one fear we identified in the voce research, 

**Speaker 13:** the fear of being sued into oblivion.

**Speaker 14:** Right. Insurance carriers right now are terrified of psychedelics. Yeah. Because they don't have any reliable data. They don't know what the actual risk is. PPN comes to 'em and says, we have the data. We can prove that our members screen for contraindications. We can prove they check. For dangerous drug interactions.

Therefore, they are a statistically lower risk. 

**Speaker 13:** It allows them to underwrite a policy where no one else can. 

**Speaker 14:** It does, it's brilliant. You're not just selling a piece of software, you're selling peace of mind. But even that isn't the main event 


## Model 3 ‘Wisdom Trust’: The Real-World Data Brokerage Trojan Horse

**Speaker 13:** because the documents say the real money, what they call the unicorn play, is model three.

The wisdom trust. 

**Speaker 14:** This is the data brokerage model. 

**Speaker 13:** Right? 

**Speaker 14:** And to really understand the scale of this, you have to understand the crisis that big pharma is facing right now. 

**Speaker 13:** I thought pharma was doing great printing money. 

**Speaker 14:** They are, but they're struggling with data. Clinical trials are these pristine, perfectly controlled artificial environments.

**Speaker 13:** Ah, 

**Speaker 14:** they exclude anyone with complex issues. You can't be in a major drug trial if you're actively suicidal or if you take five other medications or if you have a history of psychosis. 

**Speaker 13:** So the trials are kind of fake in a way. They don't represent real people with real messy lives. 

**Speaker 14:** They represent a highly sanitized version of reality.

The moment a drug is approved, where does it go? It goes out into the real world. It goes to people who are suicidal, who do take other meds. Pharma desperately needs what they call real world evidence or RWE to see what actually happens when their drugs get out into the wild. 

**Speaker 13:** And they need failure data, right?

They need to know when things go wrong. 

**Speaker 14:** Desperately clinical trials are designed to prove success. They often miss or downplay adverse events or what happens with non-responders. PPN is designed to aggregate what they call the golden record, all the data from the underground, from the clinics, from the messy real world.

**Speaker 13:** They capture the high dose data and the complex case data that clinical trials can't ethically generate. 

**Speaker 14:** Exactly right. You cannot run an FDA approved clinical trial where you give five grams of mushrooms to a suicidal person in a basement. The ethics boards would never, ever approve it, but it's happening anyway, thousands of times a week.

**Speaker 13:** PPN is just capturing the data exhaust from what is already happening. 

**Speaker 14:** Yes, and they plan to sell this anonymized, aggregated data to pharmaceutical companies for their FDA submissions and to insurance payers for their reimbursement negotiations. 

**Speaker 13:** So the software, the clinic commander is basically given away for free or sold cheap to get the data, and then they turn around and sell that data from millions.

**Speaker 14:** That is the Trojan horse. Don't think of PPN as a software company. It is a data company disguised as a set of clinical tools. They give the tools away to the underground to capture the asset. 


## Integration Hub: Using the Neuroplasticity Window After Sessions

**Speaker 13:** Okay, so that's the business side and it's incredibly ambitious, but let's look at the clinical impact. Is this actually helping patients or is it just a way to mine their experiences for data?

We talked about the integration void earlier. The V OCI research showed that patients often just drop off after the session. They have this huge life-changing experience and then. Crickets, 

**Speaker 14:** right? There's no psychological scaffolding. The drug opens a door in the mind, but if you don't walk through it and actively integrate what you learned, that door just swings shut again.

**Speaker 13:** So how does PPN address this? 

**Speaker 14:** They have a feature called the integration hub. This is designed to structure the post-session period. 

**Speaker 13:** This handles things like homework and tracking the neuroplasticity window. I love that term. 

**Speaker 14:** It's based on solid neuroscience. The research shows that after a powerful psychedelic session, say with MDMA or psilocybin, the brain enters this hyperplastic state for maybe two to four weeks old.

Rigid neural pathways are destabilized. New, healthier pathways can be formed. 

**Speaker 13:** That is the critical window for a real lasting behavior change. 

**Speaker 14:** It is the window. If you just go right back to your stressful job in your old habits and don't change anything, that window closes and you often revert to your baseline.

The integration hub tracks this period. It sends automated prompts to the patient journal about this. Practice this new breathing exercise. Talk to your partner about this. 

**Speaker 13:** It helps the practitioner structure that crucial time. 

**Speaker 14:** It creates a therapeutic wrapper around the drug itself, 

**Speaker 13:** and that's important because it proves that the therapy drives the outcome, not just the molecule, 

**Speaker 14:** which is a crucial argument for getting insurance reimbursement.

If you just give someone a pill, insurance pays for the pill. If you can prove that you provide a comprehensive therapy wrapper that improves long-term outcomes by 50%, insurance will pay for the therapy. 


## Supervision Exchange \+ Viability Engine: Mentorship and Insurance Reimbursement

**Speaker 13:** Then there's the supervision exchange. This seems to be the fix for that lone wolf problem we mentioned at the start.

**Speaker 14:** This is all about professionalizing the field from the ground up. PPN uses its network to create what they call diet matching. It uses data to match a newer practitioner with a verified mentor. What they call an elder who might have 20 plus years of experience. 

**Speaker 13:** So it's like a matchmaking service for therapists.

**Speaker 14:** It is. Or it creates supervision circles, which are small, curated groups of peers who can review difficult cases together in a secure environment. 

**Speaker 13:** So you move from being a solo artist isolated in your own practice to a network node. 

**Speaker 14:** Exactly. If you have a really tough case, maybe a client with a complex personality disorder or deep trauma, you aren't just guessing anymore.

You can tap into the global hive mind. You can pose an anonymized question to the network and get advice from people who have seen it all. It raises the standard of care for everyone. 

**Speaker 13:** And finally, for the legal license clinics. There's the viability engine. This is all about the money. It's about getting paid because right now, getting insurance to cover this stuff is a total nightmare.

**Speaker 14:** It's the biggest headache for the legal clinics. They're struggling because insurance companies deny claims left and right. They deny them because they say the treatment isn't medically necessary or isn't proven. 

**Speaker 13:** They need the right data and the right billing codes, 

**Speaker 14:** and that's what PPN provides. It uses its aggregated data to automate the reporting process.

It gives guidance on which CPT codes to use. It provides the safety analytics to prove to the payer. Look, this patient's GAD seven depression score dropped by 50% after three sessions. The safety profile is clean. You should pay for this. 

**Speaker 13:** It turns the clinical data into a check. 

**Speaker 14:** It creates the financial plumbing for the entire industry without a clear path to reimbursement.

This therapy stays a luxury item for the rich who can pay out of pocket. PPNs goal is to break that open. 


## Banking Your Hours: Anonymized Career Ledger for Future Licensing

**Speaker 13:** Now, there's one last feature in these documents that I found particularly fascinating, especially for the underground folks. It's called Banking Your Hours or the Legacy Transcript. This feels like building a bridge to the future.

**Speaker 14:** This is absolute genius. Think about the problem for a skilled underground guide. You might have 10 years of real world experience. You've guided 500 sessions. You are a true expert, but you can't put that on a resume. 

**Speaker 13:** Right. You can't put extensive experience committing federal felonies on your LinkedIn profile.

**Speaker 14:** Exactly. So when legalization finally happens like it is in Oregon, 

**Speaker 13:** yeah. 

**Speaker 14:** You're treated like a complete newbie. You have to take a basic one-on-one level training course while some 22-year-old with a fresh certificate gets the license you deserve. It's insulting and it keeps the most experienced talent out of the legal market.

**Speaker 13:** That sounds incredibly infuriating. 

**Speaker 14:** It is. So PPN offers an anonymized career ledger. You log your sessions now while you're in the gray market. The system verifies them. Cryptographically it records user hashtag 88 49 has guided 500 hours with zero hospitalizations. It tracks your safety score over time.

**Speaker 13:** So it's basically career insurance. 

**Speaker 14:** That's a perfect way to put it. When the laws change and they will change. You can walk into a state licensing board and say, here is my verified anonymized transcript. I have the experience, I have the safety record. Gimme my license. It allows the gray market to build a legitimate resume for the legal market of tomorrow without incriminating themselves.

Today 

**Speaker 13:** it's playing the long game. It really is. 

**Speaker 14:** The entire platform is playing the long game. It's about methodically moving the entire industry from shadow to sunlight. 


## Safety Scores & the Big Bet: From ‘Vibes’ to Accountability—and a Provocative Finale

**Speaker 13:** Let's talk about that big picture for a second. The safety score concept seems to be central to this whole shift moving away from just.

Vibes. 

**Speaker 14:** It's right now, trust in the underground is based on personality and social proof. You trust a shaman because they look the part or because they have cool beads or because your friend of a friend said they were cool. That is not a scalable or particularly safe way to build an industry. 

**Speaker 13:** A sociopath can have good vibes.

**Speaker 14:** A sociopath can have great vibes. PPN wants to shift the entire paradigm from, trust me, I'm a shaman to. Here is my verified safety rating based on objective data. 

**Speaker 13:** I have a 98% safety score across 500 documented sessions. 

**Speaker 14:** That changes everything. It creates real accountability in a space that has historically, and sometimes for good reason, resisted it.

It allows patients to make genuinely informed decisions. It allows the truly good actors to distinguish themselves from the reckless or predatory ones. It creates a market for safety and competence. 

**Speaker 13:** So stepping back, we've looked at the deep pain points, the burnout, the isolation, the crippling fear.

We've looked at the incredible tech, the blind vetting, the crisis logger. We've looked at the complex business models, the data trust, the insurance lock. It's just a massive, all encompassing vision. 

**Speaker 14:** It is, and it's a vision that recognizes the reality on the ground. You can't just try to regulate this industry from the top down.

It's too big, it's too decentralized, and it's too far underground. You have to build infrastructure that serves the needs of the underground first, captures the data as a byproduct, and then uses that very data to build the bridge to the legal world. 

**Speaker 13:** So it's really about offering professional plausible deniability to the underground practitioners 

**Speaker 14:** and offering operational efficiency.

To the legal clinics. 

**Speaker 13:** That's the core value prop. You protect the people doing the hard work today so you can build the legitimate industry of tomorrow. 

**Speaker 14:** That's the Trojan horse strategy. In a nutshell, 

**Speaker 13:** it's been a fascinating deep dive into a world that most people don't even know exists. We've gone from the pure chaos of the Wild West to a potential future of a data-driven, insured and connected ecosystem.

**Speaker 14:** And if this actually works, if they can pull it off, it changes the future of mental health forever. 

**Speaker 13:** Before we wrap up, I wanna leave our listeners with one final provocative thought. We've talked a lot about the data that PPN is collecting, the wisdom trust. 

**Speaker 14:** Yes. And here is the provocative question I'd like you to sit with.

PPN is setting out to capture data from the underground, the largest, wildest, most diverse dataset in the history of mental health. These are high doses. These are complex patients. These are protocols that the FDA would never ever approve in a clinical trial, 

**Speaker 13:** right? This is the forbidden data. 

**Speaker 14:** It's the forbidden data.

So what happens when we finally analyze that data? And we find out that the illegal protocols actually work better than the sterile clinical ones. 

**Speaker 13:** Whoa. 

**Speaker 14:** What happens if the data shows that a high dose psilocybin session in a comfortable living room with a caring experience guide is more effective and has better long-term outcomes than a low dose session in a sterile clinic with a nurse checking in every hour?

What does that do to the pharmaceutical model of mental health? 

**Speaker 13:** That is a massive question. Does the data end up validating the new clinical model or does it end up vindicating the underground all along? 

**Speaker 14:** That is the question. The wisdom trust will eventually answer, and the answer, whatever it is, might shake the very foundations of psychiatry.

**Speaker 13:** Wow. Something to chew on. 

**Speaker 14:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 13:** Thank you for joining us on this deep dive into the PPN portal and the future of psychedelic therapy. We'll catch you on the next one. 

**Speaker 14:** Thanks for having me.




===


# The\_Trojan\_Horse\_of\_Psychedelic\_Data


## PPN Portal: The “Calendar App” That’s Actually a Trojan Horse

**Speaker:** Called the PPN Portal. That's the Psychedelic Practitioners Network. 

**Speaker 2:** Right, and if you just glanced at the brochure for it, you'd think it's a boring piece of software. 

**Speaker:** Totally. It looks like a calendar app for therapists, something to book appointments, maybe send an invoice.

Super simple. 


## Not a Calendar App: The Trojan Horse Reveal

**Speaker 2:** But when you actually dig into the architecture and the encryption protocols and the business logic, which we have done, you realize this is not a calendar. 

**Speaker:** Not even close. The documents we have describe it explicitly as a Trojan horse, 

**Speaker 2:** and that is the single most important concept to grasp here.

The Trojan horse. 

**Speaker:** Mm-hmm. '


## The Core Problem: Illegal Psychedelics vs Massive Demand (and “Dark Data”)The Core Disconnect: Law vs. Massive Demand

**Speaker 2:** cause the central problem, this whole document stack identifies, is this massive disconnect in modern mental health. 

**Speaker:** Okay. Break that down. 

**Speaker 2:** Well, on one side you have the law. The law says these substances, psilocybin, M-D-M-A-L-S-D are largely illegal. They're schedule a drugs. 

**Speaker:** Right?

The most dangerous category officially. Yeah. 

**Speaker 2:** But then on the other side, you have this immense demand. You have millions of people who are desperately seeking healing for things that. Frankly, traditional psychiatry just hasn't been able to fix for them. 


## Who Bridges the Gap: Guides, Sitters, Underground Therapists

**Speaker:** And who's bridging that gap? 

**Speaker 2:** Thousands of practitioners, guides, sitters, underground therapists, people operating out of basements and living rooms and yurts.

And they are bridging that gap between the law and the demand. 

**Speaker:** And they are terrified. 

**Speaker 2:** They are petrified. And here's the real kicker, these people. 


## The Biggest Hidden Asset: Mental Health’s ‘Dark Data’

**Speaker 2:** These illegal operators, they're currently sitting on the largest data set in the entire history of mental health. 

**Speaker:** Wow. Say more about that. 

**Speaker 2:** I mean, they're overseeing tens of thousands of high dose sessions for incredibly difficult conditions.

**Speaker:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 2:** PTSD, treatment resistant depression, severe addiction, but because they're hiding from the law. All of that data is invisible. It's what we call dark data. It's completely unmeasured. 


## Inside the Plan: Digitizing the Underground Without Getting Everyone ArrestedThe Engineering Challenge: Digitizing a Black Market Safely

**Speaker:** So the entire premise of this PPM portal is how do we trick, or maybe incentivize is a better word, a bunch of paranoid underground drug facilitators to start uploading all their data into a centralized system.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. How do you digitize a black market without getting everybody arrested? That's the fundamental engineering challenge here, 

**Speaker:** and the answer seems to involve some pretty wild stuff. 


## How It’s Built: Encryption, Dual-Use Tech, and ‘Companies in a Trench Coat’

**Speaker:** Dual use technology, military grade encryption. 

**Speaker 2:** In a business model that is, and this is my favorite description from the documents, five different companies wearing a trench coat.

**Speaker:** I love that image. Five companies in a trench coat. We are gonna break down every single layer of that coat. 


## Roadmap of the Investigation: VOC, Phantom Shield, and the Data Question

**Speaker:** Today we're gonna look at the voice of customer research that exposes just how broken the current system is. 

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, the pain is palpable. 

**Speaker:** We're gonna look at the Phantom Shield technology, which includes these incredible things like blind vetting and crisis loggers.

And we're gonna ask the big question, is this whole thing actually about safety or is it just about packaging up that data and selling it to big farmer? 

**Speaker 2:** The billion dollar question, is this thing a shield or is it a snare? 


## VOC Research Begins: Feedback That Reads Like a Distress Signal

**Speaker:** So let's start where all good product design starts. 


## VOC Research: A Workforce Drowning in Workflow Failure

**Speaker:** The documents kick off with this really expensive voice of customer or VOC research, and I have to say, this isn't your standard.

I wish the button was blue, kind of feedback. 

**Speaker 2:** No, it reads like a distress signal. It's visceral. 

**Speaker:** It really is. 


## A Workforce Drowning: Licensed Clinics vs. Underground Reality

**Speaker:** The researchers interviewed practitioners from both sides of the aisle. You have the licensed side, you know the legal ketamine clinics, and then you have the completely underground side, the mushroom guides, and the picture that emerges is of a workforce that is just.

Drowning. 

**Speaker 2:** They identify a massive workflow failure. That's the core of it. 


## Why Psychedelic Workflows Break Everything

**Speaker:** So to understand this failure, you really have to understand the complexity of the job itself. 

**Speaker 2:** Absolutely. If you're a standard talk therapist, your workflow is, well, it's predictable. A client comes in, they sit for 50 minutes, you talk, they leave.

You write a short paragraph of notes in your electronic health record, your EHR. You're done. 

**Speaker:** Clean, simple, billable. 

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. 


## Why Psychedelic Care Breaks Normal EHRs (and Measurement-Based Care)Six-to-Eight Hour Sessions: Screening, Prep, Dosing, Integration

**Speaker 2:** But a psychedelic session, that's a six to eight hour ordeal. It's a marathon. 

**Speaker:** It's a whole different animal, a 

**Speaker 2:** whole different one. It involves extensive medical screening beforehand.

Then there's the whole preparation phase, then the actual dosing session, which has this huge variability. You never know what's gonna happen. And then crucially, the integration work afterwards. 


## The Patchwork Toolkit: IntakeQ, Signal, Excel, Spotify, Billing Apps

**Speaker:** And right now the stack or the toolkit these people are using to manage all that complexity is. Well, the research says it's basically a joke.

**Speaker 2:** It is. I was looking at the list of tools they're using. It's like a patchwork quilt of total dysfunction. 

**Speaker:** So what are they using? 

**Speaker 2:** They've got something like IntakeQ for the digital forms because it's, uh, ipi compliant, which is good, but then they're using spruce or signal for encrypted messaging because they're paranoid about surveillance.

**Speaker:** Understandably so, 

**Speaker 2:** of course. And then they've got these clunky Excel spreadsheets to track outcomes, which, you know, usually break or the data gets corrupted. They're managing the all important music on Spotify playlists, and then maybe they're using something like Simple Practice for the billing, 

**Speaker:** and none of these things talk to each other, 

**Speaker 2:** not a single one.


## Administrative Burnout: Practitioners as Accidental IT Admins

**Speaker 2:** So you have a practitioner who is, for all intents and purposes a healthcare provider, but they're spending what, 40% of their time just acting as an IT system administrator. 

**Speaker:** Just copy pasting data from Signal into Excel. From Excel into IntakeQ. It's madness. 

**Speaker 2:** It's what the documents call administrative burnout.

But it's not just annoying. 


## The Deeper Risk: Measurement-Based Care Collapses

**Speaker 2:** The research highlights a much deeper danger here. This fragmentation, it leads to a void in what we call measurement-based care. 

**Speaker:** Okay, break that down for us. What is measurement-based care in this specific context, and why is it failing so badly? 

**Speaker 2:** In standard medicine, it's simple.

If you have high blood pressure, we measure it. We give you a pill, we measure it again a month later, we know if it worked, 

**Speaker:** we have a number. It goes up or it goes down 

**Speaker 2:** exactly. 


## Why Standard EHRs Fail: You Can’t Chart a ‘Narrative Arc’ on a Sticky Note

**Speaker 2:** In psychedelic therapy, because the tools are so bad, nobody's measuring anything consistently. You can't just use a standard electronic health record in EHR for this kind of work.

**Speaker:** Why not? Why can't I just use Epic or whatever my family doctor uses? 

**Speaker 2:** Because those systems are built for the 15 minute visit. They're glorified billing machines. Mm-hmm. You go in sore throat, click. Prescribed to antibiotics, click goodbye. That's the model. 

**Speaker:** And a psychedelic session is the opposite of that.

**Speaker 2:** It's a narrative arc. It's a story. You need to know what happened at hour two when the patient started crying about their mother. You need to know what happened at hour six when their blood pressure spiked for a few minutes. You need to track the music cues. Trying to document all of that in a standard medical chart is like.

Like trying to write a novel on a sticky note. 

**Speaker:** It just doesn't fit the medium at all. 

**Speaker 2:** It doesn't fit. 


## Paper Notes, No Notes, and the Legal ‘Death Sentence’

**Speaker 2:** So what's the result? The research shows that practitioners just stop taking good notes or they keep them on paper, which is a huge security risk. And as we're gonna discuss later. Paper notes, or even worse, no notes is a legal death sentence if something goes wrong.


## Second Circle of Hell: The Lone Wolf Crisis & Supervision Desert

**Speaker:** Which brings us to the second circle of hell identified in this research. 


## The “Lone Wolf” Crisis: Training Ends, Real Emergencies Begin

**Speaker:** The isolation, they call it the lone wolf crisis. 

**Speaker 2:** This is the part that frankly, it scares me the most. 


## The Certification Cliff: Trained, Then Thrown Into the Deep End

**Speaker 2:** We're seeing this phenomenon that the researchers call the certification. 

**Speaker:** And this is about the training programs, right? The ones that are popping up everywhere, 

**Speaker 2:** right?

So you have this explosion of interest. People are paying five, $10,000 to get certified in psychedelic therapy. They take a weekend course or maybe a six month online program. They learn the history, the theory, the pharmacology. They feel confident, they feel great, 

**Speaker:** and then the course ends 

**Speaker 2:** and they are kicked outta the nest.

They're just released into the wild. And suddenly it's a Tuesday night, they're in a room with a client who has just taken four grams of psilocybin and that client is screaming, 

**Speaker:** oh wow. 

**Speaker 2:** Or they're reliving a childhood assault in vivid detail. Or they're having what's known as a spiritual emergency where their entire sense of reality is collapsing 

**Speaker:** and there's no supervisor in the next room to call for help.

There's no attending physician to page, 

**Speaker 2:** there is no one. In traditional clinical psychology, you have supervision, you have a residency, you have a mentor. You review cases with every single week. It's built in, in the underground, or even in many of these independent ketamine clinics. That infrastructure just doesn't exist.

You are a lone wolf. 

**Speaker:** The documents use the phrase supervision desert. 

**Speaker 2:** It's very apt metaphor. What happens when you're in a desert for too long? You start hallucinating. Not literally maybe, but your decision making degrades. 

**Speaker:** You lose your bearings. 

**Speaker 2:** You lose your bearings. When you're that isolated, you are forced to rely entirely on your own intuition.

You don't have a feedback loop. You don't have a peer saying, Hey, maybe you shouldn't have done that, or Have you considered this approach? This isolation creates this pressure cooker of anxiety. 


## Liability Double Bind: No Records vs Audit-Ready DocumentationThe \#1 Fear Is Liability: Criminal vs. Civil Risk

**Speaker:** That anxiety seems to center on one thing above all else. We saw this in the voice of customer survey responses.

The number one fear across the board wasn't bad trips or losing money. 

**Speaker 2:** Nope. It was liability. 

**Speaker:** This sort of damocles just hanging over their heads. 

**Speaker 2:** What documentation protects me? What documentation puts me in jail. That is the question that is haunting every single one of these people, 

**Speaker:** and it's a terrifying double bind.

This is where the Wild West reality just crashes head on into the legal system. 

**Speaker 2:** It really does. Let's look at the two types of practitioners. The research identifies first, you have the underground operator. Maybe they're working under a religious exemption, maybe they're just totally illicit. Their biggest fear is criminal liability.

**Speaker:** The EA kicking down the door. 

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. Raids. Warrants federal prison. 

**Speaker:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 2:** So their instinct, their survival strategy up to this point has been a. Write nothing down, 

**Speaker:** right? If there's no paper trail, there's no crime. That's the logic. 

**Speaker 2:** That's the logic. 

**Speaker:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 2:** Keep no records use disappearing messages, cash only.

But then you have the other side of the coin, the licensed side. The Ketamine clinics, they're terrified of civil liability 

**Speaker:** malpractice suits. Insurance audits. 

**Speaker 2:** They wanna document everything they need, what the documents call audit, ready documentation to prove they weren't being negligent. 

**Speaker:** Okay, so you have two groups with totally opposite incentives for record keeping.

**Speaker 2:** You'd think so, but here is the catch. And the PPN documents make this point brilliantly, even for the underground. The no record strategy is actually a trap. 

**Speaker:** Wait, explain that. If I'm a mushroom guide, surely having a file on my laptop labeled John doe's illegal drug session is a terrible idea. Why would I ever write that down?

**Speaker 2:** It feels incredibly counterintuitive. I know. But imagine this scenario. You're a guide. You give a client mushrooms. They have an unforeseen medical emergency, maybe a seizure. 

**Speaker:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 2:** Or maybe they get agitated and run out into traffic. 

**Speaker:** The absolute nightmare scenario. 

**Speaker 2:** The nightmare scenario. The ambulance comes, the police come.

Now you are in court. And the prosecutor is standing in front of a jury. 

**Speaker:** Okay. 

**Speaker 2:** If you have zero records, what do you look like? 

**Speaker:** You look like a drug dealer. 

**Speaker 2:** You look like a drug dealer. You look like a reckless amateur who just handed out a bag of drugs in your basement and hoped for the best. 

**Speaker:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 2:** That is the definition of negligence.

That gets you the maximum sentence. It proves you had no control, no process, no standard of care. 

**Speaker:** You have no proof that you screen them or check their medications or monitored their safety during the session. 

**Speaker 2:** Precisely, but if you can produce a secure, encrypted timestamped record that says, I screened this patient for all known cardiovascular and psychiatric contraindications.

I calculated the dose based on their body weight and the known potency of the batch. I monitored their vital signs every 30 minutes. I followed a documented safety protocol. 

**Speaker:** Even if the act itself was technically illegal, you are proving your intent to care. 

**Speaker 2:** You are distinguishing yourself from a dealer.

You are fundamentally shifting the narrative from drug distribution to unlicensed medical practice. And in the eyes of a jury. That is a massive, massive difference. 

**Speaker:** One is a major felony drug charge. The other might be a much lesser licensing violation. 

**Speaker 2:** It could be the difference between 20 years in prison and probation.

So the whole PPN strategy is to convince the underground that they need to reframe their thinking. They need to move from record keeping, which sounds like creating evidence of a crime to audit defense. 

**Speaker:** Audit defense. I like that. It's a powerful reframe, 

**Speaker 2:** but you can't just ask people to start typing descriptions of felonies into a normal database.

If I'm an underground guide, I'm not putting my client notes into Google Docs or Evernote. 

**Speaker:** No way. You'd have to be insane. 


## Phantom Shield & Blind Vetting: Trading Safety for Anonymized Data

**Speaker 2:** So you need a special kind of shield. 


## Phantom Shield: Trading Legal/Safety Defense for Anonymized Data

**Speaker:** And that brings us to the Phantom Shield. This is the part of the tech act that is designed specifically for this gray market. How do you get these people who are fundamentally paranoid for good reason?

To use the software, 

**Speaker 2:** you have to offer them something more valuable than their fear. You have to make trade. You trade them legal and safety defense in exchange for their anonymized data. And the PPM platform does this using what they call dual use technology. 

**Speaker:** Okay? What does that mean 

**Speaker 2:** to the user, the practitioner?

It looks and feels like a safety tool, a shield, but to the network to PPN, it's a data aggregator, a vacuum. 

**Speaker:** Let's look at one of the coolest features here. 


## Blind Vetting Explained: Salted Hashing to Flag Bad Actors Privately

**Speaker:** Blind vetting. This solves a huge, huge problem in the underground. How do you know your new client isn't an undercover cop or a violent stalker, or just someone who is gonna sue you for everything you have?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah. Right now they rely on what they call whisper networks. You ask a friend, Hey, I got a call from this guy, Bob, is he cool? 

**Speaker:** Which just sounds incredibly inefficient and unreliable. 

**Speaker 2:** It's terribly inefficient and it's deeply biased. It relies on social capital. If you're new to town or you're not in the ingroup.

You don't have access to the whisper network, so you're flying blind. 

**Speaker:** So how does PPN solve this with technology? 

**Speaker 2:** It's a system called Blind Hashing. This is technology that's been borrowed from the most privacy obsessed corners of the internet, like cryptocurrency and secure messengers like signal. 

**Speaker:** So walk us through the user experience.

I'm a guide, a new potential client. Let's call him. Bob texts me for the first time. What happens next? 

**Speaker 2:** You take Bob's phone number and you punch it into the PPN app on your phone. The app instantly hashes it. 

**Speaker:** Okay, what is hashing? 

**Speaker 2:** Think of a hash, like a digital fretter or a blender. It takes the phone number and turns it into a long, unique string of random characters.

It looks gibberish and crucially, it adds salt. 

**Speaker:** Salt, like table salt. What's that for? 

**Speaker 2:** In cryptography, salt is just a piece of random data that gets added to the mix before you blend it. It means that even if someone stole the entire database of hashes, they couldn't use a rainbow table to reverse engineer the original phone number.

**Speaker:** It's an extra layer of security, 

**Speaker 2:** a critical one. If you blend a strawberry with some random salt, you can't turn that smoothie back into the original strawberry. That's salted hash. The key is the PPN server never sees Bob's real phone number. 

**Speaker:** Hmm. 

**Speaker 2:** It only ever sees the gibberish string. 

**Speaker:** So the server has absolutely no idea who Bob is or what his number is.

**Speaker 2:** Correct. But, and this is the magic, it can compare that unique string of gibberish against a blacklist of other strings of gibberish that had been flagged by other practitioners in the network. 

**Speaker:** Ah, okay. I see. 


## Blind Vetting: Flagging Bad Actors Without Sharing PII

**Speaker:** So if a different guy to New York had a really bad experience with Bob, maybe Bob assaulted them or refused to pay, or was threatening and unstable, they flagged Bob's hash in the system.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. They flagged the hash as a bad actor. So when you, the guide in organ. 3000 miles away type in Bob's number. The system creates the exact same hash. It checks the database, it sees the match with the bad actor tag, and it flashes a big warning on your screen. High risk safety incident reported. 

**Speaker:** Wow.

So you get the warning, but the system never actually had to learn Bob's name or phone number. That is incredibly clever. 


## Community Immunity: Self-Policing the Underground Safely

**Speaker 2:** It's what the documents call community immunity without ever sharing personally identifiable information or PII. It allows the underground to police itself. It keeps the predators out without creating a big, juicy list of names for the DEA to seize raid.

**Speaker:** That's amazing. It's using advanced tech to solve a very human social problem. 


## Potency Normalizer: Turning Mushroom Variance Into Safe DosingPotency Normalizer: Why “3 Grams” Doesn’t Mean Anything

**Speaker:** But let's look at a physical problem. The potency normalizer. This addresses a huge safety issue that I have to admit I hadn't even thought about. 

**Speaker 2:** This is absolutely critical In a pharmacy, 10 milligrams of Prozac is always 10 milligrams of Prozac.

There's quality control, 

**Speaker:** right? It's standardized. 

**Speaker 2:** In the underground, the phrase three grams of mushrooms is an almost meaningless statement 

**Speaker:** because it's a natural product, it's biology. 

**Speaker 2:** Because biology varies wildly. One batch of mushrooms grown in slightly different conditions can be two or three times stronger than another.

Batch, a strain that's nicknamed Penis Envy is known to be significantly more potent than a more common strain like golden teachers. 


## Accidental High-Dose Events & the Real Arrest Trigger: 911 Calls

**Speaker 2:** This variance is the number one cause of what we call accidental high dose events, 

**Speaker:** which leads to panic attacks, which leads to 

**Speaker 2:** 9 1 1 calls, 

**Speaker:** right 

**Speaker 2:** and 9 1 1 calls are the number one way underground practitioners get arrested.

It's not because the police are doing some big surveillance operation. It's because your client freaked out, ran naked down the street, and a neighbor called the cops. 


## Dynamic Dose Calculator \+ Courtroom-Ready Standard of CareTurning Guesswork Into Math: The Dynamic Dosage Calculator

**Speaker:** So how does a piece of software fix biology? 

**Speaker 2:** It's a dynamic dosage calculator. You the practitioner input the strain of the mushroom, the batch data if you have it, maybe even the harvest date.

The app then cross references this with a growing database of test results and user reports, 

**Speaker:** and it calculates the effective dose 

**Speaker 2:** precisely. So if you type in three grams of penis envy, it might flash a warning that says, whoa, based on our data, that's effectively like taking six grams of a standard mushroom.

We recommend you adjust your dose. 

**Speaker:** It turns guessing into math, into harm reduction. 

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. 


## Courtroom Defense: Proving a Standard of Care With Dosage Logs

**Speaker 2:** And again, going back to our legal defense strategy, if you do end up in court after an incident, you can show the judge. Look, your Honor, I wasn't just handing out bags of drugs recklessly. I was using a validated calculation tool to ensure a safe dosage based on known potency.

**Speaker:** It proves a standard of care. It's all about building that defensible paper trail of responsibility. 

**Speaker 2:** Every feature is designed around that principle, 


## Crisis Logger ‘Cockpit Mode’: Documenting Emergencies Under StressCrisis Logger “Cockpit Mode”: Built for High-Stress Emergencies

**Speaker:** which leaves to the crisis logger. This is the feature that felt most like something out of a sci-fi movie to me. The documents describe a cockpit mode.


## Stress Physiology: Why Documentation Fails When Things Go Sideways

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, this was designed based on the physiology of stress. It's brilliant when a patient starts spiraling, maybe they are screaming, maybe they're completely dissociated and unresponsive. The practitioner is stressed too. 

**Speaker:** Of course, their fight or flight is kicking in. 

**Speaker 2:** Their cortisol spikes, their fine motor skills degrade.

They suffer from tunnel vision. It's a real biological response, so you can't expect them to calmly open a laptop, log in and type a detailed paragraph like. Patient is currently experiencing psychological distress, 

**Speaker:** right? Your fingers would be shaking. You wouldn't be able to type 

**Speaker 2:** exactly, but if you don't document what you did during that crisis, you are legally defenseless.

Later, the prosecutor will say, what did you do for those 20 minutes? Nothing. So PPN created the crisis log. 

**Speaker:** And it's a simplified interface, 

**Speaker 2:** very simplified. 


## One-Tap Actions → Forensic Timestamps: The Crisis Log in Practice

**Speaker 2:** It's an interface with massive high contrast buttons designed for high stress, low-light environments, like a pilot's cockpit in an emergency. 

**Speaker:** And what do the buttons say?

**Speaker 2:** Very simple. Clear actions, things like vital signs, normal verbal support provided, offered water administered chemical intervention like a Xanax called Emergency services. You just tap them as you do them, 

**Speaker:** and the system creates a log in the background. 

**Speaker 2:** It creates a forensic timestamp trail. 10.0 2:00 PM Distress noted.

10.0 5:00 PM Verbal deescalation started 10.2 F from pm. Trip killer administered 10.4 5:00 PM Patient, stable and responsive. 


## Duty of Care on Record: From Chaos to Managed Clinical Event

**Speaker:** It proves you didn't abandon the patient. You are actively managing the situation. 

**Speaker 2:** It proves duty of care in a courtroom. That simple timestamped log is the difference between. I panicked and didn't know what to do, and I followed a standard documented safety protocol.

It transforms a chaotic, terrifying event into a managed clinical event. 


## Follow the Money: If PPN Isn’t a Nonprofit, What’s the Business?

**Speaker:** It's incredible how much thought has gone into protecting the practitioner here, but let's zoom out. 


## ‘Five Models in a Trench Coat’: How PPN Actually Makes Money

**Speaker:** PPN isn't a non-profit. They aren't building all this just to keep people out of jail. How does this thing actually make money?

Because looking at the business models, this is where it gets really complex. 

**Speaker 2:** It gets really, really savvy. 


## “Five Models in a Trench Coat”: Unzipping the Ecosystem

**Speaker 2:** It's not just one business, it's an ecosystem. And this is where we get that great line. The five models in a trench coat, 

**Speaker:** five models in a trench coat. Okay. Let's unzip the coat. What's model number one?


## Model 1 & 2: Clinic Commander SaaS \+ Insurance Lock-In Risk EngineModel 1 — Clinic Commander: The B2B SaaS Wedge for Legal Clinics

**Speaker 2:** Model one is called clinic commander. 

**Speaker:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 2:** This is the straightforward B2B SaaS play, 

**Speaker:** so software as a service. 

**Speaker 2:** Right. This is the wedge. It's the nice clean dashboard we've been talking about, sold to the legal clinics. It solves that immediate administrative burnout we discussed earlier. They charge, say 500, $2,000 per location per month.

**Speaker:** It's a high probability, fast way to get revenue in the door. It keeps the lights 

**Speaker 2:** on. Yeah, it keeps the lights on. It pays the engineers. But honestly, in the grand scheme of things, it's just the funding mechanism. It's a loss leader to pay for the development of the real asset. 


## Model 2 — Risk Management Engine: Insurance as the Retention Lock

**Speaker:** Which brings us to model two, the risk management engine.

The documents describe this as 

**Speaker 2:** intech, and I would call this the retention lock. It's what keeps people on the platform. P. PN plans to partner with insurance carriers to offer group malpractice insurance to its members. 

**Speaker:** Okay. That's a huge benefit. 

**Speaker 2:** It's massive, huh? But here's the catch. You can only get access to this specially negotiated insurance if you are a verified member of the network who is actively using the PPN safety protocols.

**Speaker:** Ah. So if you decide to leave the software, you lose your insurance. 

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. It creates enormous switching costs. You can't just switch to a cheaper calendar app if that app doesn't come with your liability shield. But it also solves the number one fear we identified in the voce research, 

**Speaker:** the fear of being sued into oblivion.

**Speaker 2:** Right. 


## Underwriting With Proof: How Safety Protocol Data Wins Insurers

**Speaker 2:** Insurance carriers right now are terrified of psychedelics. Yeah. Because they don't have any reliable data. They don't know what the actual risk is. PPN comes to 'em and says, we have the data. We can prove that our members screen for contraindications. We can prove they check. For dangerous drug interactions.

Therefore, they are a statistically lower risk. 

**Speaker:** It allows them to underwrite a policy where no one else can. 

**Speaker 2:** It does, it's brilliant. You're not just selling a piece of software, you're selling peace of mind. 


## Model 3 — The Wisdom Trust: The ‘Unicorn’ Data Brokerage Play

**Speaker 2:** But even that isn't the main event 


## Model 3 ‘Wisdom Trust’: The Real-World Data Trojan Horse

**Speaker:** because the documents say the real money, what they call the unicorn play, is model three.

The wisdom trust. 

**Speaker 2:** This is the data brokerage model. 

**Speaker:** Right? 


## Big Pharma’s Data Problem: Trials Don’t Match Messy Reality

**Speaker 2:** And to really understand the scale of this, you have to understand the crisis that big pharma is facing right now. 

**Speaker:** I thought pharma was doing great printing money. 

**Speaker 2:** They are, but they're struggling with data. Clinical trials are these pristine, perfectly controlled artificial environments.

**Speaker:** Ah, 

**Speaker 2:** they exclude anyone with complex issues. You can't be in a major drug trial if you're actively suicidal or if you take five other medications or if you have a history of psychosis. 

**Speaker:** So the trials are kind of fake in a way. They don't represent real people with real messy lives. 

**Speaker 2:** They represent a highly sanitized version of reality.

The moment a drug is approved, where does it go? It goes out into the real world. It goes to people who are suicidal, who do take other meds. 


## Real-World Evidence: Capturing Failure Data & Complex Cases

**Speaker 2:** Pharma desperately needs what they call real world evidence or RWE to see what actually happens when their drugs get out into the wild. 

**Speaker:** And they need failure data, right?

They need to know when things go wrong. 

**Speaker 2:** Desperately clinical trials are designed to prove success. They often miss or downplay adverse events or what happens with non-responders. PPN is designed to aggregate what they call the golden record, all the data from the underground, from the clinics, from the messy real world.

**Speaker:** They capture the high dose data and the complex case data that clinical trials can't ethically generate. 

**Speaker 2:** Exactly right. You cannot run an FDA approved clinical trial where you give five grams of mushrooms to a suicidal person in a basement. The ethics boards would never, ever approve it, but it's happening anyway, thousands of times a week.

**Speaker:** PPN is just capturing the data exhaust from what is already happening. 


## The Trojan Horse: Clinical Tools as a Data Company Disguise

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and they plan to sell this anonymized, aggregated data to pharmaceutical companies for their FDA submissions and to insurance payers for their reimbursement negotiations. 

**Speaker:** So the software, the clinic commander is basically given away for free or sold cheap to get the data, and then they turn around and sell that data from millions.

**Speaker 2:** That is the Trojan horse. Don't think of PPN as a software company. It is a data company disguised as a set of clinical tools. They give the tools away to the underground to capture the asset. 


## Clinical Impact: Integration Hub & the Neuroplasticity WindowClinical Impact Check: Helping Patients vs. Mining Experiences

**Speaker:** Okay, so that's the business side and it's incredibly ambitious, but let's look at the clinical impact. Is this actually helping patients or is it just a way to mine their experiences for data?

We talked about the integration void earlier. The V OCI research showed that patients often just drop off after the session. They have this huge life-changing experience and then. Crickets, 

**Speaker 2:** right? There's no psychological scaffolding. The drug opens a door in the mind, but if you don't walk through it and actively integrate what you learned, that door just swings shut again.

**Speaker:** So how does PPN address this? 


## Integration Hub: Using the Neuroplasticity Window After Sessions

**Speaker 2:** They have a feature called the integration hub. This is designed to structure the post-session period. 

**Speaker:** This handles things like homework and tracking the neuroplasticity window. I love that term. 

**Speaker 2:** It's based on solid neuroscience. The research shows that after a powerful psychedelic session, say with MDMA or psilocybin, the brain enters this hyperplastic state for maybe two to four weeks old.

Rigid neural pathways are destabilized. New, healthier pathways can be formed. 

**Speaker:** That is the critical window for a real lasting behavior change. 

**Speaker 2:** It is the window. If you just go right back to your stressful job in your old habits and don't change anything, that window closes and you often revert to your baseline.

The integration hub tracks this period. It sends automated prompts to the patient journal about this. Practice this new breathing exercise. Talk to your partner about this. 

**Speaker:** It helps the practitioner structure that crucial time. 

**Speaker 2:** It creates a therapeutic wrapper around the drug itself, 

**Speaker:** and that's important because it proves that the therapy drives the outcome, not just the molecule, 

**Speaker 2:** which is a crucial argument for getting insurance reimbursement.

If you just give someone a pill, insurance pays for the pill. If you can prove that you provide a comprehensive therapy wrapper that improves long-term outcomes by 50%, insurance will pay for the therapy. 


## Supervision Exchange \+ Viability Engine: Mentorship and Insurance ReimbursementSupervision Exchange: Mentors, Circles, and the ‘Global Hive Mind’

**Speaker:** Then there's the supervision exchange. This seems to be the fix for that lone wolf problem we mentioned at the start.

**Speaker 2:** This is all about professionalizing the field from the ground up. PPN uses its network to create what they call diet matching. It uses data to match a newer practitioner with a verified mentor. What they call an elder who might have 20 plus years of experience. 

**Speaker:** So it's like a matchmaking service for therapists.

**Speaker 2:** It is. Or it creates supervision circles, which are small, curated groups of peers who can review difficult cases together in a secure environment. 

**Speaker:** So you move from being a solo artist isolated in your own practice to a network node. 

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. If you have a really tough case, maybe a client with a complex personality disorder or deep trauma, you aren't just guessing anymore.

You can tap into the global hive mind. You can pose an anonymized question to the network and get advice from people who have seen it all. It raises the standard of care for everyone. 


## Viability Engine: Billing Codes, Outcomes Proof, and Reimbursement

**Speaker:** And finally, for the legal license clinics. There's the viability engine. This is all about the money. It's about getting paid because right now, getting insurance to cover this stuff is a total nightmare.

**Speaker 2:** It's the biggest headache for the legal clinics. They're struggling because insurance companies deny claims left and right. They deny them because they say the treatment isn't medically necessary or isn't proven. 

**Speaker:** They need the right data and the right billing codes, 

**Speaker 2:** and that's what PPN provides. It uses its aggregated data to automate the reporting process.

It gives guidance on which CPT codes to use. It provides the safety analytics to prove to the payer. Look, this patient's GAD seven depression score dropped by 50% after three sessions. The safety profile is clean. You should pay for this. 

**Speaker:** It turns the clinical data into a check. 

**Speaker 2:** It creates the financial plumbing for the entire industry without a clear path to reimbursement.

This therapy stays a luxury item for the rich who can pay out of pocket. PPNs goal is to break that open. 


## Banking Your Hours: The Anonymized Career Ledger for LegalizationBanking Your Hours: Anonymized Legacy Transcript for Future Licensing

**Speaker:** Now, there's one last feature in these documents that I found particularly fascinating, especially for the underground folks. It's called Banking Your Hours or the Legacy Transcript. This feels like building a bridge to the future.

**Speaker 2:** This is absolute genius. Think about the problem for a skilled underground guide. You might have 10 years of real world experience. You've guided 500 sessions. You are a true expert, but you can't put that on a resume. 

**Speaker:** Right. You can't put extensive experience committing federal felonies on your LinkedIn profile.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. So when legalization finally happens like it is in Oregon, 

**Speaker:** yeah. 

**Speaker 2:** You're treated like a complete newbie. You have to take a basic one-on-one level training course while some 22-year-old with a fresh certificate gets the license you deserve. It's insulting and it keeps the most experienced talent out of the legal market.

**Speaker:** That sounds incredibly infuriating. 

**Speaker 2:** It is. So PPN offers an anonymized career ledger. You log your sessions now while you're in the gray market. The system verifies them. Cryptographically it records user hashtag 88 49 has guided 500 hours with zero hospitalizations. It tracks your safety score over time.

**Speaker:** So it's basically career insurance. 

**Speaker 2:** That's a perfect way to put it. When the laws change and they will change. You can walk into a state licensing board and say, here is my verified anonymized transcript. I have the experience, I have the safety record. Gimme my license. It allows the gray market to build a legitimate resume for the legal market of tomorrow without incriminating themselves.

Today 

**Speaker:** it's playing the long game. It really is. 

**Speaker 2:** The entire platform is playing the long game. It's about methodically moving the entire industry from shadow to sunlight. 


## From ‘Vibes’ to Verified Safety Scores: Building Accountability at Scale

**Speaker:** Let's talk about that big picture for a second. The safety score concept seems to be central to this whole shift moving away from just.

Vibes. 

**Speaker 2:** It's right now, trust in the underground is based on personality and social proof. You trust a shaman because they look the part or because they have cool beads or because your friend of a friend said they were cool. That is not a scalable or particularly safe way to build an industry. 

**Speaker:** A sociopath can have good vibes.

**Speaker 2:** A sociopath can have great vibes. PPN wants to shift the entire paradigm from, trust me, I'm a shaman to. Here is my verified safety rating based on objective data. 

**Speaker:** I have a 98% safety score across 500 documented sessions. 

**Speaker 2:** That changes everything. It creates real accountability in a space that has historically, and sometimes for good reason, resisted it.

It allows patients to make genuinely informed decisions. It allows the truly good actors to distinguish themselves from the reckless or predatory ones. It creates a market for safety and competence. 

**Speaker:** So stepping back, we've looked at the deep pain points, the burnout, the isolation, the crippling fear.

We've looked at the incredible tech, the blind vetting, the crisis logger. We've looked at the complex business models, the data trust, the insurance lock. It's just a massive, all encompassing vision. 

**Speaker 2:** It is, and it's a vision that recognizes the reality on the ground. You can't just try to regulate this industry from the top down.

It's too big, it's too decentralized, and it's too far underground. You have to build infrastructure that serves the needs of the underground first, captures the data as a byproduct, and then uses that very data to build the bridge to the legal world. 

**Speaker:** So it's really about offering professional plausible deniability to the underground practitioners 

**Speaker 2:** and offering operational efficiency.

To the legal clinics. 

**Speaker:** That's the core value prop. You protect the people doing the hard work today so you can build the legitimate industry of tomorrow. 

**Speaker 2:** That's the Trojan horse strategy. In a nutshell, 

**Speaker:** it's been a fascinating deep dive into a world that most people don't even know exists. We've gone from the pure chaos of the Wild West to a potential future of a data-driven, insured and connected ecosystem.

**Speaker 2:** And if this actually works, if they can pull it off, it changes the future of mental health forever. 


## Final Thought: What If the ‘Forbidden Data’ Vindicates the Underground?Final Provocation: What If ‘Forbidden Data’ Proves the Underground Right?

**Speaker:** Before we wrap up, I wanna leave our listeners with one final provocative thought. We've talked a lot about the data that PPN is collecting, the wisdom trust. 

**Speaker 2:** Yes. And here is the provocative question I'd like you to sit with.

PPN is setting out to capture data from the underground, the largest, wildest, most diverse dataset in the history of mental health. These are high doses. These are complex patients. These are protocols that the FDA would never ever approve in a clinical trial, 

**Speaker:** right? This is the forbidden data. 

**Speaker 2:** It's the forbidden data.

So what happens when we finally analyze that data? And we find out that the illegal protocols actually work better than the sterile clinical ones. 

**Speaker:** Whoa. 

**Speaker 2:** What happens if the data shows that a high dose psilocybin session in a comfortable living room with a caring experience guide is more effective and has better long-term outcomes than a low dose session in a sterile clinic with a nurse checking in every hour?

What does that do to the pharmaceutical model of mental health? 

**Speaker:** That is a massive question. Does the data end up validating the new clinical model or does it end up vindicating the underground all along? 

**Speaker 2:** That is the question. The wisdom trust will eventually answer, and the answer, whatever it is, might shake the very foundations of psychiatry.

**Speaker:** Wow. Something to chew on. 

**Speaker 2:** Yeah. 

**Speaker:** Thank you for joining us on this deep dive into the PPN portal and the future of psychedelic therapy. We'll catch you on the next one. 

**Speaker 2:** Thanks for having me.

# Why\_Psychedelic\_Software\_Refuses\_Patient\_Records


## Psychedelic Renaissance vs. the Chaotic Reality on the Ground

**Speaker 11:** Welcome back to the Deep Dive. So today we're looking at something that, um, it feels a bit like we've found a map to a hidden city. 

**Speaker 12:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 11:** We all see the headlines, right? The psychedelic renaissance. It's on Netflix, it's in the news. You hear about psilocybin treating depression, ketamine for PTSD, and it all sounds.

Well, it sounds glamorous. 

**Speaker 12:** It does. It sounds like a massive breakthrough. But if you, you know, if you actually talk to the people on the ground, the therapists, the guides, the clinic owners 

**Speaker 11:** mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 12:** The reality is a lot less glamorous and a lot more, uh, chaotic. 

**Speaker 11:** Chaotic is putting it lightly. Yeah. We're talking about a really high stakes environment where these practitioners are terrified of basically three things.

Law enforcement raids. 

**Speaker 12:** Yep. 

**Speaker 11:** Malpractice lawsuits that could just bankrupt them and And just strain up administrative burnout. 

**Speaker 12:** Exactly. It is still very much the wild west out there. 

**Speaker 11:** Yeah. 


## Inside PPN: The ‘Boring’ Brand Voice Built for Medical Legitimacy

**Speaker 12:** And that is why the documents we're looking at today are so fascinating. We've got our hands on the internal brand identity and voice of customer strategy docs for a platform called PPN.

**Speaker 11:** Or, uh, formally the psychedelic practitioner network research. And just to set the stage here, these are not public marketing brochures. These are the internal guidelines for building a piece of software to, well, to try and tame this Wild West. And the first thing that jumped out at me, I know you loved this, was the tone of voice section.

**Speaker 12:** Oh, absolutely. 

**Speaker 11:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 12:** It tells you everything. It really tells you where this industry is trying to go. 

**Speaker 11:** They have a list of forbidden words. You can't say revolutionary. 

**Speaker 12:** Nope. 

**Speaker 11:** You can't say game changing. You can't say disruptive. 

**Speaker 12:** Which is so ironic because the therapy itself is, I mean, it's often described as all of those things.

**Speaker 11:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 12:** But the PN portal is basically saying. Stop. If we wanna be taken seriously by the medical establishment, by insurance, by the dea. 

**Speaker 11:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 12:** We have to be boring. 

**Speaker 11:** We have to be clinical intelligence. Not some tech disruptor. 

**Speaker 12:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 11:** So their mission is to turn this whole chaotic industry into a data-driven science, and they're doing it in a way that is just.

It's completely counterintuitive. 


## The No‑PHI Strategy: ‘No Seizure Risk’ and Why It Matters

**Speaker 11:** Let's unpack the core differentiator here, because when I first read it, I thought I'd misunderstood. 

**Speaker 12:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 11:** The platform refuses to store protected health information or PHI in medical software. That sounds like building a library, but refusing to stalk any books. 

**Speaker 12:** It does, but this is the genius of their strategy.

It solves two massive problems at once. The first one is the fear of seizure. 

**Speaker 11:** Okay. 

**Speaker 12:** Imagine you're a practitioner operating in a. You know, a legal gray area, maybe an entheogenic church using psilocybin or even a ketamine clinic worried about DEA oversight, 

**Speaker 11:** right? 

**Speaker 12:** If you use a standard electronic health record system and law enforcement raids you, 

**Speaker 11:** they seize the servers.

**Speaker 12:** They seize the servers, they have your patient list. That's the nightmare scenario. It's 

**Speaker 11:** complete error. 

**Speaker 12:** PPN portal. Explicitly markets no seizure risk. If law enforcement seizes their data, they get nothing. No patient names, no addresses, just anonymous clinical data points, 

**Speaker 11:** which is great for safety. 


## The Benchmarking Loophole: Turning Anonymous Data into Clinical Intelligence

**Speaker 11:** But here's where it gets really, really interesting for me, the benchmarking loophole, because they don't have the patient's identity, 

**Speaker 12:** right?

**Speaker 11:** They aren't bound by the same I iPad restrictions that lock down data in other systems. 

**Speaker 12:** Precisely look at their competitor, Osmond great platform, but it's a traditional medical record system. They hold PHI. 

**Speaker 11:** So they're locked down, 

**Speaker 12:** totally locked down because of High pi. They can't just take everyone's data, mix it all together and show you how you compare to the clinic down the street.

**Speaker 11:** Yeah, 

**Speaker 12:** it's a huge privacy violation. 

**Speaker 11:** But PPM portal can 

**Speaker 12:** QPN portal basically says, look, we don't know who these patients are so we can aggregate everything. And this creates what they call the network benchmark. 

**Speaker 11:** As a therapist, I can log in and see, okay, my safety scores are in the, the 62nd percentile compared to the entire network.

**Speaker 12:** Exactly that. And that is the clinical intelligence they're selling. You're not just, you know, documenting notes for yourself. You're seeing where you stand in the entire ecosystem. It turns a solitary practice into a data-driven one without risking patient privacy. 

**Speaker 11:** That is a massive shift and it leads us directly into the specific ways people are using this.


## Use Case \#1: ‘Prove You’re Not Reckless’ (Safety Surveillance as Legal Shield)

**Speaker 11:** The source docs break it down into use cases and the titles alone, they're really telling. The first one is literally called prove. You're not reckless. 

**Speaker 12:** So blunt, isn't it? But that is the reality for what they call entheogenic religion operators. 

**Speaker 11:** These are the people doing psilocybin ceremonies often under like.

Religious protection frameworks, 

**Speaker 12:** right? But to law enforcement, it can just look like unlicensed therapy. The problem is how do you prove you aren't just getting people high in a basement? 

**Speaker 11:** Right? 

**Speaker 12:** So PPN portal provides a safety risk matrix and safety surveillance. It's just a standardized way to screen patients and track any adverse events.

**Speaker 11:** And there was a specific anecdote in the source material that just. It blew my mind. It said this documentation saved a DEA petition. 

**Speaker 12:** Yes, because they had the data. They could go to a regulator and say, look, we have a rigorous screening process. We track every bad outcome. We're operating with a clear standard of care.

It provides a durable legal pathway. It stops a raid from becoming a total shutdown. 

**Speaker 11:** It's a shield. It's like saying we're not reckless, we're researchers. 

**Speaker 12:** Exactly. We have the data. 


## Use Case \#2: Reducing Malpractice Exposure for Ketamine Clinics

**Speaker 11:** Okay, so let's move to the more legit side. The licensed Ketamine clinics, they're not as worried about raids, but they're terrified of being sued.

Use case number two, reduce malpractice exposure. 

**Speaker 12:** This is the ethical minefield that practitioners always talk about. Liability insurance for psychedelic therapy is incredibly hard to get. It's expensive 

**Speaker 11:** and the fear is what if a patient has a bad trip or some kind of psychological break? 

**Speaker 12:** The clinic gets sued for negligence.

**Speaker 11:** So how does the software fix that? 

**Speaker 12:** By proving you followed the standard of care. If you use their safety benchmark and you can prove that your safety protocols are in, say, the 80th percentile of the network, it is very hard for a lawyer to argue you are being negligent. 

**Speaker 11:** And the numbers back this up, the source cited, what was it?

$50,000 saved in legal fees 

**Speaker 12:** and a 10% reduction in insurance premiums. For a small clinic that is real money, it turns data into an insurance policy. 


## Use Case \#3: State Compliance in Oregon/Colorado’s ‘Regulatory Void’

**Speaker 11:** Then you've got the third group, the people in places like Oregon and Colorado where psilocybin is legal at the state level. Use case three. Compliant with state regulations, 

**Speaker 12:** or as the document calls it, the regulatory void.

The rules in these states are changing like monthly. One month you have to report X, the next month you have to report Y, and 

**Speaker 11:** then practitioners are just drowning in spreadsheets trying to keep up. 

**Speaker 12:** So PPN Portal automates that? Yeah. And automated compliance dashboard, the ROI, they cite is saving 15 hours a month on manual tracking.

That's two full work days. Just recovered from, 

**Speaker 11:** yeah, 

**Speaker 12:** from administrative. Hell. 

**Speaker 11:** It really paints this picture of a practitioner who's just besieged on all sides by the DEA, by lawyers, by state bureaucrats. And the software is their armor. 

**Speaker 12:** That's a great way to put it. Yeah. 


## VOC Wake‑Up Call: Today’s Patchwork Tools and the ‘Digital Clinical Container’

**Speaker 11:** But here's where we pivot. Because for me the most interesting part of these documents wasn't the software they have built.

It's the software they realized they needed to build. They did this massive voice of customer research project and it exposed that the tools everyone is currently using are, um, completely broken. 

**Speaker 12:** This section was fascinating. They call it priority hashtag one pain point, the software failure. 

**Speaker 11:** The source describes the current workflow of a psychedelic therapist.

Yeah, and it's. It's almost comical. It's a total patchwork. 

**Speaker 12:** It really is. They're using IntakeQ for forms, spruce for messaging, Excel for tracking outcomes, and this is the kicker. Spotify for the music, 

**Speaker 11:** Spotify and standard electronic health records. The EHRs 

**Speaker 12:** useless here. I mean, think about it. A standard EHR is built for a 15 minute doctor's visit.

**Speaker 11:** Yeah, 

**Speaker 12:** you come in, check blood pressure, write a prescription, you leave 

**Speaker 11:** right? 

**Speaker 12:** A psychedelic session lasts six to eight hours. You can't fit an eight hour journey into a 15 minute box, 

**Speaker 11:** not a chance. 

**Speaker 12:** So PPN Portal is building what they call a digital clinical container. It includes a session logger. Imagine a tool where you can just tap to log events over that six hour arc, 

**Speaker 11:** like patient took dose at 10:00 AM.

Patient experienced distress at 1130. 

**Speaker 12:** Intervention applied. Yeah. Yeah. It captures the narrative of the session, not just a billing code, and it integrates measurement-based care. 

**Speaker 11:** So they're using specific scales like the MEQ 30, the Mystical Experience questionnaire, 

**Speaker 12:** right, or the Watts Connectedness Scale.

**Speaker 11:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 12:** These are specific tools to measure the depth of a psychedelic experience, and they're automated right into the platform. 

**Speaker 11:** So they're moving from just admin work to actually capturing the science of the experience. 


## The Lone Wolf Problem: Supervision Exchange \+ Verified Elder Directory

**Speaker 11:** But the research also highlighted a much deeper problem than software It. It highlighted the human toll on these practitioners.

**Speaker 12:** This is the lone wolf problem. 

**Speaker 11:** The source describes the transition from trainee to practitioner as a perilous cliff. You finish your certification, you're all excited, and then boom, you are alone in a room with someone going through intense trauma and you have no one to talk to. 

**Speaker 12:** And the nature of this work is so intense.

The documents mention things like spiritual emergencies. Or, uh, erotic transference, 

**Speaker 11:** which is when a patient in an altered state projects, you know, romantic or sexual feelings onto the therapist, 

**Speaker 12:** right? And dealing with that alone is incredibly difficult. It's dangerous for a therapist's career. It just leads to burnout.

**Speaker 11:** So what's the PPN solution? 

**Speaker 12:** They're building a supervision exchange. It's basically a matching system. They pair practitioners in diets, so partners. Or in circles of six to eight people, 

**Speaker 11:** and my favorite part of this, the verified elder directory. 

**Speaker 12:** Yes. Mentors with 20 plus years of experience in a field that feels so new, just acknowledging that there are elders who've been doing this underground for decades is a really important bridge.

**Speaker 11:** It connects the new clinical world with the old underground wisdom. 

**Speaker 12:** It digitizes that mentorship model. 


## Patient Integration Hub: Neuroplasticity Windows and Preventing Drop‑Off

**Speaker 11:** There's one more gap they identified. Mm-hmm. And this one is for the patients. They call it the integration hub, 

**Speaker 12:** right? This addresses the churn problem. A patient has this profound experience. They leave the clinic and then what 

**Speaker 11:** the source says, they lack psychological scaffolding.

**Speaker 12:** Exactly. Without integration, without processing what happened, the benefits can just fade. The patient drops off. The PPN solution is to track neuroplasticity windows. 

**Speaker 11:** That sounds very sci-fi. 

**Speaker 12:** It's rooted in neuroscience, though. After a session, the brain is more malleable for a certain period, days, maybe weeks.

The integration hub assigns homework and tracks progress during that specific window to make sure the change actually sticks. 

**Speaker 11:** So it's not just have a nice trip, it's here's how you rebuild your life over the next two weeks. 

**Speaker 12:** Which improves outcomes, which keeps patients coming back, which, you know, stabilizes the clinic's revenue.

It all connects. 


## Money & Insurance: CPT Code Confusion and Real‑World Evidence for Reimbursement

**Speaker 11:** Speaking of revenue, we have to talk about the financial reality because all the philosophy in the world doesn't matter if the clinic goes broke 

**Speaker 12:** and the transition from cash pay to insurance. Is the single biggest hurdle in the industry right now. 

**Speaker 11:** The confusion around CPT codes, these are the billing codes.

It seems massive. The source mentions codes like 0 8 2 0 T, or 9 0 8 3 7, and apparently nobody knows how to use them correctly, 

**Speaker 12:** or the insurance companies just deny them. They say this isn't medically necessary, and this is where PPNs data comes back in. They provide real world evidence packages. 

**Speaker 11:** Which is basically a dossier proving, Hey look, this works.

**Speaker 12:** Yes. And the ROI here is staggering. The source cites a single clinic that increased its revenue by $120,000 a year just by getting reimbursement approved. 

**Speaker 11:** $120,000 for many clinics. That's the difference between staying open and closing down, 

**Speaker 12:** and that's for just 20 patients. When you scale that up, you realize this data isn't just about science, it is about survival.


## From Tool to Practice OS: What PPN’s Data Could Mean for the Future of Care

**Speaker 11:** So let's just step back and look at the big picture here. PPN Portal is rebranding. They're moving from just being a documentation tool to what they call a practice operating system. 

**Speaker 12:** That is the key shift. 

**Speaker 11:** Hmm. 

**Speaker 12:** They're not just a notebook. They want to be the OS for the entire clinic. 

**Speaker 11:** And going back to that tone of voice document, that refusal to use hype, they wanna use.

Indigo colors, standard fonts, boring language, 

**Speaker 12:** and that is the sign of a maturing industry. When you're new, you have to shout revolution to get noticed. But when you're establishing yourself as a legitimate medical field. You wanna be boring, 

**Speaker 11:** you wanna be reliable, 

**Speaker 12:** you wanna be clinical intelligence. 

**Speaker 11:** It's almost like they're trying to make psychedelic therapy as mundane as, I don't know, dentistry, and that's actually a really good thing.

**Speaker 12:** It is because mundane means covered by insurance. Mundane means accessible. Mundane means safe. 

**Speaker 11:** So here's where it gets really interesting to me. Looking forward if PPN succeeds, if they get all these clinics on board. Yeah. All using this no PHI model, 

**Speaker 12:** they end up holding the keys to the kingdom. 

**Speaker 11:** They will have the largest data set of psychedelic outcomes in the world 

**Speaker 12:** without owning a single patient's name.

**Speaker 11:** Exactly. So they won't just be helping clinics survive lawsuits. They'll be the ones who can definitively say this protocol works and that one doesn't. 

**Speaker 12:** This dosage is effective. That one is risky, 

**Speaker 11:** and that changes everything because right now so much of this relies on small clinical trials or just anecdotal evidence.

My shaman said this works. Imagine having data from 10,000 sessions across hundreds of clinics updated in real time. 

**Speaker 12:** It's a different world. It 


## Closing Thoughts: When Real‑World Data Rewrites the Standard of Care

**Speaker 11:** really raises a massive question for the future of mental health care. We've spent decades relying on pharmaceutical trials that are often. Let's just say curated.

What happens to the standard of care When we finally have the raw, unfiltered data to prove what actually works in the real world, 

**Speaker 12:** we might just find out that the Wild West had some things right. All along. Mm-hmm. We just, we just needed the data to prove it. 

**Speaker 11:** That is a fascinating thought to leave on.

Thanks for diving deep with us today. 

**Speaker 12:** Always a pleasure.

# Why\_Psychedelics\_Must\_Become\_Boring\_To\_Survive


## Why Psychedelics’ Real Fight Is Operational (Not Lab Coats vs Robes)

**Speaker 15:** Welcome back to the Deep Dive. We are doing something, uh, a little different today. 

**Speaker 16:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 15:** Usually when the topic of psychedelics comes up, I mean, whether it's in the news, on, on social media, anywhere, really, it feels like it's dominated by two very loud, very distinct voices, 

**Speaker 16:** right? 

**Speaker 15:** You've got the Renaissance.

Crowd on one side, you know, these are the neuroscientists, the biotech investors, the people showing you these incredible brain scans and talking about neuroplasticity, 

**Speaker 16:** the lab coat contingent, as I call them. 

**Speaker 15:** Exactly. The lab coats. And then on the complete other side, you have the ancient wisdom crowd.

Mm-hmm. The people talking about shamans and ancestral healing, spiritual awakenings, you know, ego death, 

**Speaker 16:** the robe contingent. 

**Speaker 15:** It's robe contingent. Right? It's either a lab coat or a robe. 

**Speaker 16:** That's the whole conversation usually. 

**Speaker 15:** But today we aren't talking about either of those. We are going to look at the messy, muddy, really high stakes middle ground.

We are looking at the people who are actually trying to build organizations right now, 

**Speaker 16:** today in the real world. 

**Speaker 15:** Oh yeah. Clinics, churches, therapy practices, and they're doing it in an environment that is, well, frankly, it's hostile to them. 

**Speaker 16:** It's a great pivot because the question isn't really. Do the drugs work anymore?

Mm-hmm. I mean, we have data on that. We have clinical trials. That debate is, you know, it's moving forward, 

**Speaker 15:** right? 

**Speaker 16:** The new question, the one that I think keeps these operators awake at night is, can I run a business or a church or a practice without getting raided by the police, sued by a patient, or just shut down by the DEA.

**Speaker 15:** It's the clash between like spiritual enlightenment and an insurance adjuster, 

**Speaker 16:** which is just a brutal collision. And you know, usually the insurance adjuster wins. 


## Today’s Stack: Court Records, News Clips, and Reddit Reality Checks

**Speaker 15:** So here is our stack for today. We aren't just looking at medical journals. We have dug into federal court records, I mean actual legal filing, 

**Speaker 16:** the primary documents.

**Speaker 15:** We have news transcripts from kj, ZZ in Phoenix. We have voice of the customer market research, which is fascinating, and we've even, uh, scraped Reddit threads to see what actual users are saying when they think, you know, no one is watching. 

**Speaker 16:** It's a boots on the ground mix. This isn't theoretical at all.

This is operational. This is what people are struggling with day to day. 


## Three Survival Strategies: Priest, Supplement Maker, Therapist

**Speaker 15:** Our mission today is to profile the specific pain points of the people trying to professionalize psilocybin and ketamine. We're gonna look at three sort of characters who represent three really distinct survival strategies in this market.

Mm-hmm. First, we have the entheogenic priest. Represented by a guy named Bridger Lee Jensen. Then we have the scientific supplement creator, Dr. Jason Allen. And finally, the functional therapist. Julian rela 

**Speaker 16:** three people in what you'd call the same industry theoretically, but they are fighting completely different wars.

**Speaker 15:** And that leads to the aha moment we're building toward. By the end of this deep dive, you're gonna understand why religious freedom might actually be a fatal marketing error. 

**Speaker 16:** It sounds so counterintuitive. 

**Speaker 15:** It does, and you'll also see why the most boring things on earth. I'm talking about audit trails, standardized forms, and CPT codes from insurance companies.

Why those are the only things that will save this movement from collapsing on itself. 

**Speaker 16:** It's just wild. But in this specific legal climate, bureaucracy is the only shield that actually works. If you wanna touch the divine, you better have your paperwork in triplicate. 


## The Entheogenic Route: Singularism, Sacrament, and RFRA

**Speaker 15:** So let's start in the deep end, the wild West.

We need to talk about Bridger Lee Jensen and this concept he founded called Singulars. 

**Speaker 16:** Right? So Jensen represents what we're calling the entheogenic route, and for anyone new to that term, entheogen translates roughly to generating the divine within. 

**Speaker 15:** Okay, 

**Speaker 16:** so he's the founder of a group that frames the use of psilocybin, you know, magic mushrooms not as a drug, and not even as a medicine in the clinical sense we just talked about, but as a sacrament.

**Speaker 15:** Which brings us immediately to the first amendment of the Constitution. 

**Speaker 16:** Correct. The entire legal argument here is based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act or RFRA. The promise is basically this substance is central to my religious exercise. It's our communion, 

**Speaker 15:** and if the government stops me from using it, they are substantially burdening my religion.

**Speaker 16:** That's the argument. 

**Speaker 15:** It sounds solid in theory. I mean, we've seen it work for the Native American Church with peyote. There is precedent there. 

**Speaker 16:** There is, 

**Speaker 15:** but we have sources here, specifically a federal court order and transcripts from a raid that took place in Utah that show this is not a magic shield you can just hold up to stop a SWAT team from kicking in your door.

**Speaker 16:** It is definitely not a magic shield. It's a legal battleground. 

**Speaker 15:** Yeah, 

**Speaker 16:** and for Jensen, it got very physical, very, very fast. 


## When the Constitution Meets a SWAT Team: The Utah Raid

**Speaker 15:** Walk us through the raid because looking at the source text here. This wasn't just a paperwork issue, this was, I mean, this was a door kicking issue. 

**Speaker 16:** No, it was visceral. 

**Speaker 15:** Hmm. 

**Speaker 16:** Our sources show that law enforcement executed a search warrant.

Now, usually in a drug bust, you expect them to seize the controlled substance, and they did. They took the psilocybin 

**Speaker 15:** of course, 

**Speaker 16:** but, and this is the absolute nightmare scenario for any religious operator, they also seized. What Jensen refers to as his scriptures, they took his written records, his ceremonial texts.

**Speaker 15:** Wow, that that just stops me in my track. 

**Speaker 16:** It's chilling. 

**Speaker 15:** Imagine running a church, truly believing you are protected by the Constitution and the police kick down the door and confiscate your holy books along with the communion. 

**Speaker 16:** It's what came up in the voice of the customer data we analyzed. They call it a catastrophic interruption.

**Speaker 15:** That's a good term for it. 

**Speaker 16:** The fear isn't just jail time, although that is obviously on the table. It's the total disruption of the community. You can't hold services, you can't comfort your members. Your entire narrative is hijacked by the police report. 


## Messaging Whiplash: ‘We’re a Church’ vs ‘We’re Therapy’

**Speaker 15:** Speaking of narrative, this is where I wanna drill down because looking at Jenssen's case and especially the Reddit threads that we scraped discussing it, there seems to be a self-inflicted wound here.

**Speaker 16:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 15:** You call it messaging whiplash. 

**Speaker 16:** This is the critical insight for anyone watching this space. It's so important. If you look at how Gru like singular is market themselves, there's a fundamental contradiction at play. 

**Speaker 15:** Okay. 

**Speaker 16:** To the courts and to the police, they say, we are a church. This is religious exemption.

We are no different than a Catholic priest giving the Eucharist. You have to leave us alone. 

**Speaker 15:** That's the legal posture, but to the potential customer, to the person looking for help, 

**Speaker 16:** to the person scrolling Instagram. Or looking for healing from trauma. They use completely different language. It's clinical language.

**Speaker 15:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 16:** They talk about safety protocols, supervised sessions, integration. 

**Speaker 15:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 16:** Healing, trauma, mental health benefits. 

**Speaker 15:** So officer, I'm a priest, but customer, I'm basically a therapist. 

**Speaker 16:** Precisely. And the public is so much smarter than these operators seem to realize. We analyze Reddit threads reacting to Jensen and singular.

Mm-hmm. And the skepticism is just lethal. 

**Speaker 15:** What were people saying? 

**Speaker 16:** The sentiment was things like. Wait a minute. This looks like unlicensed therapy dressed up in robes to dodge taxes and the DEA. 

**Speaker 15:** Ouch. That's a trust collapse right there. 

**Speaker 16:** It is, because think about it. In the medical world, trust comes from your license and your data.

In the religious world, trust comes from tradition and sincerity and lineage, 

**Speaker 15:** right? 

**Speaker 16:** If you mix the two, if it looks like you're using religion as a legal loophole for a for-profit medical clinic, you lose both audiences. You just end up looking like a scam to everyone. 


## The Trust & Liability Trap: Who’s Accountable When Things Go Wrong?

**Speaker 15:** The sources suggest this doesn't just hurt Jenssen's organization.

It, it sort of poisons the well for everyone else in the space. 

**Speaker 16:** It absolutely does. It gives ammunition to the critics who say, see, this whole psychedelic movement is just unregulated chaos. These aren't churches. These are drug dealers with a clever lawyer and a website, 

**Speaker 15:** and it puts the customer, or I guess the parishioner in a really weird spot because if they go there for therapy, but the provider is claiming its religion.

What happens if something goes wrong? 

**Speaker 16:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 15:** You can't sue a priest for malpractice in the same way you can sue a licensed doctor. 

**Speaker 16:** The legal standing is completely different. 

**Speaker 15:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 16:** And that ambiguity creates massive anxiety. The pain points, research we looked at, shows that potential participants are, um.

They're terrified of this legal gray area. They don't want to get arrested leaving the church, 

**Speaker 15:** right? They wanna feel safe, not just spiritually, but legally. 

**Speaker 16:** They wanna know who is accountable. If they have a terrifying adverse reaction, is it God? Is it the facilitator? Is it a board of directors? Nobody knows.


## The Path to Defensibility: Governance, Boards, Bylaws, Theology

**Speaker 15:** So if I'm an entheogenic operator listening to this right now, someone who genuinely believes in the spiritual power of these substances, what is the path out of this mess? Because the hiding in the shadow strategy clearly has a very short shelf life. 

**Speaker 16:** The sources all point to a deep desire for defensibility.

That's the word that kept coming up. 

**Speaker 15:** The defensibility 

**Speaker 16:** operators were looking for a way to file a petition. A formal RFRA exemption request and get a stamp of approval from the government before the raid happens. They wanna move from claiming legitimacy after the fact to proving it through governance upfront.

**Speaker 15:** They wanna stop looking over their shoulder constantly. 

**Speaker 16:** Exactly. But that requires a level of organizational discipline that, you know, most of these wild west groups just don't have yet. You can't just buy a robe and call it a church. 

**Speaker 15:** What does that discipline look like practically? 

**Speaker 16:** It means you need a board.

You need bylaws. You need a written history of theology. You need to look like a religion that a judge can recognize, not just a weekend retreat. 


## Hard Pivot to ‘Boring’: Dr. Jason Allen’s Evidence-Based Supplement Play

**Speaker 15:** Okay, let's pivot. That's a deep dive into the religious angle. Now let's look at someone who is running in the complete opposite direction. Let's talk about Dr.

Jason Allen and his company Reasonable Remedies. 

**Speaker 16:** This is a total 180 degree turn. Dr. Allen isn't fighting for religious freedom. He isn't talking about spirits or ancestors or the cosmos. He is leaning hard into. Evidence-based supplements. 

**Speaker 15:** Even the name reasonable remedies, it feels designed to lower your blood pressure.

It's so sensible. 

**Speaker 16:** That's the entire strategy. 


## Hype Overload to Quality Control: Standardization as Credibility

**Speaker 16:** Dr. Allen is analyzing the market and seeing a completely different pain point. Yeah, misinformation, fatigue. 

**Speaker 15:** Oh, I feel that in my bones. You open social media and it's just a barrage of influencers. 

**Speaker 16:** It's in the overload. 

**Speaker 15:** One guy's telling you that microdosing psilocybin will fix your marriage.

Another is saying it cures depression, and a third is saying it will help you launch a billion dollar startup all by Tuesday. 

**Speaker 16:** It's pure hype overload. I call it the crypto of psychedelics. Everyone's a guru. Everyone has a secret protocol, and Dr. Allen is betting that a significant chunk of the population is just tired of the guru model.

**Speaker 15:** They're tired of the breathless promises. 

**Speaker 16:** They want epidemiology. Oh, they want clinical research. They want a certificate of analysis from a third party lab. 

**Speaker 15:** So he's not selling the mystic, he's selling the measurable. 

**Speaker 16:** He represents the regulated pharmacy approach. If Bridger Jensen is the wild West. Dr.

Allen is the guy in the clean white lab coat meticulously checking the expiration dates on the bottles. 

**Speaker 15:** He's addressing the safety anxiety 

**Speaker 16:** completely. He's answering the questions, what is actually in this pill? Is it pure? Is the dosage consistent? Has it been tested for heavy metals? Those are the questions his customer is asking.

**Speaker 15:** It's a play for credibility through standardization and quality control. 

**Speaker 16:** And you have to remember, it appeals to a demographic that will never, ever, ever step foot in a shamanic circle, 

**Speaker 15:** right? 

**Speaker 16:** There are millions of people who might benefit from these compounds, but who are just allergic to the woowoo aesthetic.

They don't wanna sit on a floor cushion and listen to flute music for six hours. 

**Speaker 15:** They just want a pill that works. 

**Speaker 16:** They want a pill that works from a doctor. They trust that they can take it home. Alan is building the bridge for them. 

**Speaker 15:** It's interesting because reasonable remedies feels like it's trying to make psychedelics.

Well, boring, and maybe that's the point. 

**Speaker 16:** Boring is safe. Boring is legal. Boring gets approved by the FDA boring scales, 


## The Functional Therapist: Julian Ella’s Outcome-First ‘Trojan Horse’

**Speaker 15:** which brings us to our third character, Julian Ella. He's not a priest and he's not a supplement manufacturer. He's a licensed therapist. But looking at his Psychology Today profile, which was one of our key sources, I noticed something really interesting.

He barely mentions the substances at all. 

**Speaker 16:** This is what we're calling the functional approach. Ella is fascinating because he represents a kind of Trojan horse strategy, and I mean that in a good way. He doesn't lead with the modality, he leads with the outcome. 

**Speaker 15:** What do you mean by that? 

**Speaker 16:** His profile, his marketing.

It's all about the problems people have. He talks about burnout, A DHD, anxiety, relationship, friction. These are everyday struggles. 

**Speaker 15:** He isn't selling a trip. He isn't selling transcendence or meeting God. 

**Speaker 16:** No, he is selling. I can help you keep your job, or I can help you save your marriage, or I can help you focus on your work.

**Speaker 15:** He's selling the house, not the hammer you use to build it. 

**Speaker 16:** That's a perfect analogy, and this highlights a massive shift in the patient mindset. 

**Speaker 15:** Hmm, 

**Speaker 16:** five years ago, the novelty of the drug itself was the selling point. Come try magic mushrooms. It was edgy. It was edgy, it was new. The early adopters have already done it.

The mass market, the people he is talking to, they don't care about being edgy, they just wanna function better. Pharrell's message is essentially, I solve problems. Psychedelics happen to be one of the tools in my kit alongside talk therapy and somatic work. 

**Speaker 15:** It feels so much more grounded. It's practical.

**Speaker 16:** It is. It's de-stigmatizing. By normalizing, he's saying, this isn't a lifestyle change, it's just a treatment. Like getting a prescription for an antide depress. 


## The Big Convergence: Three Battles, One Legitimacy Problem

**Speaker 15:** So we have these three distinct battles being fought. The religious operator is fighting for his very legal existence. The scientific operator is fighting for data-driven trust, and the functional therapist is fighting for patient outcomes, 

**Speaker 16:** and they're all orbiting the same central problem, which is how do you legitimize a highly stigmatized practice?

How do you take something that was. Illegal and associated with counterculture for 50 years and make it part of normal everyday life. 


## Therapists in the Gray Zone: The ‘Silent Majority’ of Psychedelic Care

**Speaker 15:** Well, that there is a huge group we haven't touched on yet, and you could argue they are the most stressed out people in this entire ecosystem. 

**Speaker 16:** Uhhuh 

**Speaker 15:** the silent majority.

The regular therapists who are caught in the gray zone, 

**Speaker 16:** this is such a huge demographic, and they get no attention to the headlines. We are not talking about the people running underground circles. We're talking about your standard licensed marriage and family therapist, your LMFT or your. Licensed clinical social worker, your LCSW, 

**Speaker 15:** people with a license to protect.

**Speaker 16:** They have a license, a lease on a nice office and very expensive malpractice insurance, and their clients are already using psychedelics 

**Speaker 15:** constantly. Clients are going to retreats in Jamaica or Oregon or maybe just buying mushrooms from a friend and then coming back to their regular therapist on Tuesday morning saying, okay, help me process this experience.


## The Ethical Tightrope: Integration Sessions & Guilt by Association

**Speaker 16:** This creates what we're calling the ethical tightrope. 

**Speaker 15:** It's a tightrope over a pit of alligators, 

**Speaker 16:** and the alligators are lawyers and licensing boards. 

**Speaker 15:** So let's walk through a scenario. A client comes in on a Tuesday and says, Hey, I took a massive dose of mushrooms this weekend, and I had this profound realization that I, I hate my mother and I need to get a divorce immediately.

**Speaker 16:** Right? A classic integration session now. The therapist didn't give the drug. They weren't there. They advised against it probably, but they have to deal with the fallout. This is called integration, 

**Speaker 15:** but the fear for the therapist is guilt by association. 

**Speaker 16:** Exactly. If the therapist engages too deeply. If they help the client prepare for a future session or if they seem to be encouraging this illegal behavior in any way, they risk being accused of conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act, 

**Speaker 15:** or at the very least losing their license for unprofessional conduct, 

**Speaker 16:** correct.

The state licensing boards are extremely conservative. 


## The Documentation Dilemma: Notes, Malpractice, and No Standard of Care

**Speaker 16:** They do not like ambiguity and this fear, it manifests most acutely in what we're calling the documentation dilemma. This was a major, major theme in the practitioner adjacent sources we looked at, like PubMed and the private therapy forms.

Therapists are paralyzed when it comes to their notes. 

**Speaker 15:** The question is, what on earth do I write down? 

**Speaker 16:** It's an impossible question if I write in my clinical notes. Patient discussed upcoming psilocybin session and their intentions. Am I just documenting a medical fact or am I creating an exhibit for the prosecution?

Am I admitting that I knew a felony was about to be committed and I did nothing to stop it? 

**Speaker 15:** It's a confession almost. But if I don't write it down, 

**Speaker 16:** and then two weeks later, the patient has a psychotic break, ends up in the hospital and sues you for malpractice. 

**Speaker 15:** Ah, 

**Speaker 16:** the first thing their lawyer will subpoena are your notes.

And they'll ask, did you know about their drug use? If you knew and you didn't document it, that is textbook malpractice. You failed to record a critical clinical factor that could have influenced your treatment plan. 

**Speaker 15:** It's a complete double bind. You're damned if you document it and you're damned if you don't.

**Speaker 16:** And because this is such an emerging field, there is no established standard of care yet in medicine, standard of care is your shield. If you can prove you did what any other reasonable doctor would do in that situation, you are generally safe from a lawsuit. 

**Speaker 15:** But here. What is the standard? 

**Speaker 16:** The standard is being written in real time through lawsuits and tragedies.

There is no textbook on how to ethically document your patient's illegal mushroom use without getting yourself arrested. 

**Speaker 15:** So while the headlines are about psychedelic breakthroughs and how wonderful the future is, the actual practitioners on the ground are sweating over their intake forms, just terrified of a lawsuit that could end their career.

**Speaker 16:** That is the day-to-day reality. The industry is creating safety protocols. They don't wanna be mavericks or cowboys. They want a checklist. They want a safe harbor where they can talk to their clients, honestly, without risking everything. 


## Licensed Ketamine Clinics: Legal Treatment, Messy Outcomes

**Speaker 15:** Which brings us to the places that do have a checklist, or at least are supposed to, the licensed clinics.

Mostly Ketamine at this point, right? Right. They are illegal. They have the drug, they have the licenses. They must be printing money, right? 

**Speaker 16:** You would think so. Ketamine is FDA approved as an anesthetic and it's off-Label. Use for depression is perfectly legal, so the door is wide open, but they have a whole different set of headaches, and the biggest one is the messy reality of outcomes.

**Speaker 15:** We talked about measuring things with Dr. Allen earlier, but for a clinic, measurement isn't just about science. It's about the survival of the business. 

**Speaker 16:** It's entirely about business. 


## Measuring Mental Health: Survey Fatigue, Data Drag, and Flying Blind

**Speaker 16:** The sources highlight a massive friction point scales. How do we actually measure getting better, 

**Speaker 15:** right? It's not like fixing a broken leg.

You can see the bone knit together on an x-ray. How do you take an x-ray of less existential dread 

**Speaker 16:** use psychometric scales. These are standardized questionnaires, but which ones do we use? The PHQ nine for depression, the GD seven for anxiety, the cap, PS five for PTSD, the QD sr. 

**Speaker 15:** It's an alphabet soup of surveys.

I can see patients getting tired of that, 

**Speaker 16:** and it leads to huge operational drag. You can't ask a severely depressed patient to fill out a 50 question survey every single time they walk in the door. They won't do it. It causes survey fatigue. The data quality plummets, but without that data, the clinic is flying blind.

They have no idea if their protocols are actually working better than a placebo. 


## Why a ‘CoStar for Clinics’ Misses the Point: Outcomes vs. Real Estate Metrics

**Speaker 15:** And speaking of data, there was a really specific, almost weird note in the source material that caught my eye. It mentioned. Alternatives to CoStar. Now, I know CoStar, that's a massive platform for commercial real estate data, 

**Speaker 16:** right?

It tells you vacancy rates, square footage, prices. 

**Speaker 15:** So why on earth is that showing up in a deep dive about psychedelics? 

**Speaker 16:** This is such a crucial distinction that the source makes, and it really shows the immaturity of the current market investors, especially from the real estate and finance world. They look at the psychedelic clinic space.

The brick and mortar clinics. Yeah. And they say, we need a CoStar for this industry. 

**Speaker 15:** They mean they want market data like a map, 

**Speaker 16:** right? They wanna know where are all the clinics? What are their rent prices? What's the market saturation in Austin versus Denver? It's like a Zillow for Ketamine clinics. 

**Speaker 15:** But the source argues that this is a fundamental category error.

**Speaker 16:** It's a huge one. Comparing psychedelic healthcare to real estate fails because the value isn't in the location or the square footage. The value is in the clinical outcome. 

**Speaker 15:** Explain that a little more. 

**Speaker 16:** A building is static. An office building in Denver is, you know, it's an asset with a clear value.

Healthcare is biological and dynamic and incredibly complex. The industry doesn't need market data right now. Knowing there are five clinics in Denver doesn't help you if you don't know which one actually works. 

**Speaker 15:** Ah, 

**Speaker 16:** what they need are clinical registries. 

**Speaker 15:** They need to know about efficacy. 

**Speaker 16:** They need to be able to answer the question.

Does protocol A work better than protocol B? For a 40-year-old male with treatment resistant PTSD. A real estate database can't tell you that the customer, in this case, the clinician and the smart investor, needs defensible documentation regarding efficacy. They need to prove that the treatment changes lives, not just that they paid the rent on time.

**Speaker 15:** Why is that proof so urgent? Is it just for, you know, scientific curiosity? 

**Speaker 16:** No, it's for pure survival. 


## The Reimbursement Trap: From Cash-Pay Luxury to Insurance-Grade Evidence

**Speaker 16:** It all comes down to the reimbursement trap. 

**Speaker 15:** The money, 

**Speaker 16:** it's always the money. Right now, insurance coverage for these treatments is spotty at best. Ketamine infusions can cost anywhere from 400 to $800 a pop.

A full course of treatment is thousands of dollars and insurance usually just says, no, that's experimental. 

**Speaker 15:** So most clinics are forced into a cash pay model, 

**Speaker 16:** which automatically right out of the gate restricts access to people who have three or $4,000 lying around for a treatment. 

**Speaker 15:** It makes it a luxury good.

A boutique spa treatment for the worried. Well, 

**Speaker 16:** exactly. And the clinics know this isn't sustainable. You run out of rich people in your city eventually to scale, to actually reach the millions who need this. They need insurance. They need Blue Cross. They need Aetna. They need UnitedHealthcare. 

**Speaker 15:** But insurance companies don't pay for vibes.

**Speaker 16:** No, they don't pay for breakthroughs or spiritual awakenings or feeling more connected. They pay for data. They pay for what's called payer grade evidence. The clinics are desperate to move from. We think this helps to, here's a graph showing a 40% reduction in hospitalization rates over the next 12 months for this patient population.

**Speaker 15:** That's the language Insurance speaks. Hospitalization rates reduce downstream costs. 

**Speaker 16:** Exactly. So the transformation that's needed here is for these clinics to stop acting like wellness spas and start acting like hospital departments. They need to generate hard economic data that proves to the insurance company that they're saving them money in the long run.


## Two Survival Playbooks: Religious Operators vs. Clinical Clinics

**Speaker 15:** So let's try to synthesize all of this. We've surveyed the landscape. We've got the religious sector dodging raids. We've got the licensed clinics fighting for reimbursement, and we've got the individual therapists just hiding in the gray zone. 

**Speaker 16:** It's a messy picture. 

**Speaker 15:** It is. If we look forward, what are the roads out of this mess, what's the path to maturity?

**Speaker 16:** Our analysis suggests there are two very distinct paths forward, A strategic playbook, if you will, for the two main sides of this coin. 

**Speaker 15:** Okay. 


## Religious Model Checklist: Consistency, Governance, and Records

**Speaker 15:** Let's start with segment A. The religious operator. If you are the church of psilocybin and you wanna survive the next five years without your archives being seized by the FBI, what is your checklist?

What do you need to do tomorrow? 

**Speaker 16:** The synthesis here is, uh, it's brutally simple. You don't need better results or more enlightenment. Right now. You need survivability. 

**Speaker 15:** Okay. How do you get that? 

**Speaker 16:** Three things based on the sources first, consistency. You absolutely need a repeatable liturgy or process. 

**Speaker 15:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker 16:** If you are doing different things every weekend, sometimes it's mushrooms, sometimes it's ayahuasca, sometimes it's just a breathwork circle. You look like an event planner, not a church. 

**Speaker 15:** Courts look for sincerity and consistency and religious practice. 

**Speaker 16:** Exactly. Second governance. This is where so many of these groups fail.

Who handles the sacrament? Who counts the money? Who screams the new members for psychological risks? If the answer to all of those questions is the founder, you have a massive problem 

**Speaker 15:** because that looks like a cult or just a drug dealing operation with one kingpin, 

**Speaker 16:** you need checks and balances. You need a board of elders.

You need accountability structures that a judge can look at and say, okay, this looks like a real organization. 

**Speaker 15:** The third item on the checklist 

**Speaker 16:** records, and this goes right back to the radon Jenssen's group. You need documentation that proves control and intent. You need to be able to show a regulator.

Here is our intake form. Here is our safety protocol. Here is our incident log from last year, and here is the lock safe where we store the sacrament. 

**Speaker 15:** It's all about moving. The perception from this is a clever loophole to this is a legitimate institution. 

**Speaker 16:** That is the only way the religious model survives long term.

You have to become boring enough and predictable enough that the government decides you aren't a threat worth their time. 

**Speaker 15:** Okay, that's fascinating. 


## Clinic Checklist: Efficiency, Automation, and Audit Readiness

**Speaker 15:** Now, for segment B, the license clinic clinic, if you're running a ketamine center, you aren't worried about raids, but you are absolutely worried about bankruptcy.

What is their checklist for survival? 

**Speaker 16:** For them, it's all about. Efficiency and proof. 

**Speaker 15:** Okay, break that down for us. 

**Speaker 16:** First, measurable outcomes. We've touched on this, but it's the most important piece. You need data that translates directly to business outcomes, and that's specifically means fewer insurance denials.

**Speaker 15:** So you need to automate the collection of those PHQ nine scores. So you have the data ready, 

**Speaker 16:** you need it automated, and you need it presented in a way that an insurance case manager can understand in 30 seconds. Second item on the list, reduced admin burden. 

**Speaker 15:** The staff burnout problem, 

**Speaker 16:** it's huge. This came up over and over in the pain point analysis.

These clinics are high emotion environments. If your nurses are also spending 40% of their day data entering forms and chasing paperwork, they will quit. You need automated systems. You need technology that gets outta the way and lets clinicians be clinicians. 

**Speaker 15:** And the third piece for the clinics 

**Speaker 16:** audit readiness.

The regulatory eye is turning toward these clinics. As the industry grows from dozens of clinics to hundreds and then thousands, scrutiny is gonna grow exponentially. 

**Speaker 15:** You need to be ready for an audit at any time. 

**Speaker 16:** You need to be able to answer hard questions from the state medical board instantly. You can't be scrambling through disorganized file cabinets when they show up.

It has to be buttoned up. 


## Boring Is Scalable: Professionalization Replaces the Wild West

**Speaker 15:** So for both groups, the church on one hand and the clinic on the other, the solution seems to be well bureaucracy. Paperwork 

**Speaker 16:** in a way, yes, but I would reframe it. I call it professionalism 

**Speaker 15:** fair. 

**Speaker 16:** The wild west days are closing fast. The era of the charismatic guru or the maverick doctor who just wings it is fading.

The era of the compliance officer, the data manager, and the in-house legal team is here. 

**Speaker 15:** It's a sobering thought. We started this whole deep dive with Renaissance and mysticism, and we're ending with compliance officers and insurance codes. But maybe that's a good thing. 

**Speaker 16:** Boring is scalable. Excitement, almost by definition, is usually unscalable.

If we want these treatments to actually reach the millions of people who need them, not just the wealthy, not just the adventurous. We need to embrace the boring, we need the infrastructure. 

**Speaker 15:** Boring is scalable. I really like that. 

**Speaker 16:** We should put it on a t-shirt. 


## Final Question: Will Spiritual ‘Speakeasies’ and Clinical Care Ever Merge?

**Speaker 15:** Before we go, I wanna leave the listener with a final thought to chew on.

We've described these two parallel tracks here, the religious path and the clinical path, 

**Speaker 16:** right? Two very different worlds. 

**Speaker 15:** As regulations tighten, as the industry matures, do you think these two worlds will ever merge, or are we gonna see a permanent split? 

**Speaker 16:** That is the billion dollar question, isn't it? We are seeing a divide forming right now.

On one side you have the speakeasy for spirituality. The religious exemption route might just become a permanent tolerated underground serving people who want community and ritual and mystery. 

**Speaker 15:** And 

**Speaker 16:** on the other, on the other, the clinical route becomes just another sterile branch of standard healthcare.

It'll be efficient, it'll be covered by insurance, but it might feel like getting any other medical procedure. It will serve people who just want symptom reduction. 

**Speaker 15:** And the real question hanging over all of this is, which one of those actually heals people better? 

**Speaker 16:** Yeah. Is the sterile efficient insurance covered clinic what the human soul actually needs to heal from deep trauma?

Or is there something in the messy, communal, slightly chaotic and deeply human aspect of the religious model that is actually part of the cure? 

**Speaker 15:** Does the bureaucracy kill the magic, or is it the only thing that can save it? 

**Speaker 16:** We'll have to watch and see. It's gonna be a fascinating decade. 

**Speaker 15:** That's it for this deep Death.

Thanks for listening. We'll see you on the next one. 

**Speaker 16:** Stay curious.

# Building\_the\_Operating\_System\_for\_Psychedelic\_Practice


## Inside the PPN Portal Roadmap: Why This ‘Dry’ Doc Reads Like a Thriller

**Speaker 5:** Welcome back to the Deep Dive. It is Thursday, February 12th, 2026, and today we're doing something a little bit different. 

**Speaker 6:** Yeah, we are. 

**Speaker 5:** Usually we're looking at a, you know, a finished product or a published study, but today we are really looking under the hood of a business in motion. We've got our hands on a strategic internal document.

It's titled Use Cases, PPN, portal Roadmap. 

**Speaker 6:** It sounds kind of dry, doesn't it? Yeah. Roadmap. But when you actually read this thing, it's, 

**Speaker 5:** yeah, 

**Speaker 6:** it reads more like a thriller or maybe a rescue mission. 

**Speaker 5:** Exactly. It feels like we're looking at a state of the union address for a company that's at this, uh, massive crossroads.

**Speaker 6:** Right? 

**Speaker 5:** On one hand, they've built some incredibly sophisticated tech, but on the other hand. 


## The 65% Alignment Wake‑Up Call: Built a Ferrari, Users Need a Jeep

**Speaker 5:** There is a number on page one that just stops you in your tracks. 

**Speaker 6:** You're talking about the strategic alignment score, 

**Speaker 5:** right? It's sitting at 65%. Now, if I got a 65% on a test in school, my parents would've grounded me.

But for a tech company, what does that actually mean? 

**Speaker 6:** It means you built a Ferrari, but your customer lives on a dirt road. Really needs a Jeep. It suggests they built what they thought the industry needed, you know, high-end data tools, but they missed what practitioners are actually screaming for, 

**Speaker 5:** and what is that 

**Speaker 6:** help with their daily survival.

**Speaker 5:** So the mission for this deep dive is to unpack how this company, PPN Portal. Plans to fix that. They're pivoting from being a data tool to becoming the operating system for psychedelic practice, 

**Speaker 6:** and the stakes are huge. 

**Speaker 5:** Oh, absolutely. We're talking about a plan to double their revenue potential to over $2.4 million in annual recurring revenue.

**Speaker 6:** And to get there, they have to solve what the document calls three bleeding neck pain points. And I love that term, bleeding neck. It implies this isn't just an annoyance, you know, like a mosquito bite. 

**Speaker 5:** No, 

**Speaker 6:** this is life or death for these clinics. 


## What PPN Portal Does Today: Point Solutions for Data, Safety, and Benchmarking

**Speaker 5:** So let's set the scene. It's early 2026. What does PPN portal actually do right now?

Because they haven't been doing nothing, they have shipped product. 

**Speaker 6:** They have, and to be fair, what they've built is high quality. The document lists the current state. They have a protocol builder for, um, fast clinical data entry. 

**Speaker 5:** Okay. 

**Speaker 6:** They have a clinical intelligence platform for benchmarking outcomes against other clinics and.

They have safety surveillance for tracking adverse events, 

**Speaker 5:** which all sounds very responsible. I mean, if you're administering powerful psychedelics, you need to track safety. You absolutely need to know if your outcomes are good. 

**Speaker 6:** Absolutely. They also have an interaction checker for drugs and a data export feature.

These are what we call point solutions. They solve very specific isolated problems, 

**Speaker 5:** so if you just need to check a drug interaction, this tool is great. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 5:** Okay, so if the tools are good, why is the alignment score a D minus? Why are the users unhappy? 

**Speaker 6:** It's because of the so what factor? The analysis in the document points out a really critical gap.

These tools handle data. They help you analyze what happened after the session, or check safety before it. But they don't handle the workflow. Ah, they don't help the practitioner get through the chaos of their actual day. 


## Pain Point \#1 — The ‘Frankenstein Stack’ and Admin Burnout

**Speaker 5:** And that brings us to the first massive pain point from their voice of customer research.

This is the stuff that jumped out at me. There's a quote here from a user that just says, administrative burnout from fragmented tools is killing us. 

**Speaker 6:** That is the sound. Of a customer who is ready to cancel their subscription. And when you look at what they're dealing with, I mean, it makes total sense. The document calls it the Frankenstein stack.

**Speaker 5:** The Frankenstein stack. I love that image. It's like they've stitched together this monster just to get through the day, break that down for us. 

**Speaker 6:** So it's a digital nightmare to run a single patient through therapy. They're patching together four or five completely disconnected tools 

**Speaker 5:** like wood. 

**Speaker 6:** They're using IntakeQ.

For their intake forms. Then they switch tabs to spruce for secure messaging. Then they open Excel to track clinical outcomes manually. Then maybe simple practice for the calendar and then Oz mine for something else. 

**Speaker 5:** That sounds exhausting. Just listening to it. 

**Speaker 6:** It is, and the document puts a number on it.

They call it context switching. Every time you switch tabs or log into a new system, your brain has to, you know, recalibrate it breaks your flow, 

**Speaker 5:** right? 

**Speaker 6:** They estimate this Frankenstein approach is costing practitioners five to 10 hours a week. 

**Speaker 5:** That's a full workday. Just lost to clicking between tabs and trying to remember passwords.

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. 


## From Tool to Operating System: One Tab to Run the Whole Clinic

**Speaker 6:** That is why the strategic opportunity here is to build an operating system. The idea is instead of being one of five tabs open on the browser, PPN portal wants to be the only tab open 

**Speaker 5:** like the iPhone. You don't carry a calculator, a camera, A GPS, and a phone anymore. You just carry the iPhone 

**Speaker 6:** precisely.

And the business logic behind that is really compelling. If you're just a data tool, you're competing for a small slice of the budget. The document notes, they're currently charging about what, $399 a month, 

**Speaker 5:** which is a decent chunk of change. But if it's just for data, it's arguably a luxury. 

**Speaker 6:** Right? But if you're the operating system, if you handle scheduling, billing, messaging, intake, you're the backbone of the business.

You can charge $999 a month, but more importantly, you expand your total addressable market, your tam. You aren't just selling to the data nerds who love charts. You're selling to every single practitioner who just wants to run a business. 

**Speaker 5:** And let's talk about the stickiness factor, because I imagine once you're the os, it's hard to break up.

**Speaker 6:** It's nearly impossible if I just store my clinical data in your system. Sure, I can export a CSV file and leave. If my entire billing history, my patient calendar, my client messaging logs, all of it is woven into your platform. 

**Speaker 5:** You're not going anywhere. 

**Speaker 6:** I am never leaving. The switching costs are astronomically high.

You effectively own their workflow. 

**Speaker 5:** So to fix this Frankenstein nightmare, they're proposing a whole new set of use cases basically to eat the whole stack. 

**Speaker 6:** They do. And that's ambitious. But according to this document, it's the number one pain point. If they don't fix this, they just remain a nice to have and in a tight market, nice to haves, get cut, 

**Speaker 5:** must have stay.

Okay. 


## Pain Point \#2 — Practitioner Isolation & the Supervision Marketplace (Use Case 13)

**Speaker 5:** Let's move to pain point number two. And this one feels a lot more human. It's less about efficiency and more about the, uh. Emotional reality of the job. 

**Speaker 6:** Yeah. This one is really poignant. The quote here is, I feel isolated. The unique challenges of psychedelic assisted therapy require specialized supervision.

That's hard to find. 

**Speaker 5:** It makes sense. You're doing this intense work dealing with trauma. Often in a small private practice, you don't have colleagues down the hall to debrief with, 

**Speaker 6:** and right now. The current reality described in the document is pretty bleak. There is no centralized marketplace. 

**Speaker 5:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 6:** If you want supervision or mentorship, where do you even go?

The document says people are relying on underground telegram or signal groups. 

**Speaker 5:** That sounds incredibly sketchy for a medical profession. Find your supervisor on telegram. 

**Speaker 6:** It sounds like you're buying something illicit, not seeking professional guidance. 

**Speaker 5:** Right. It's a liability nightmare and a quality control disaster.

Or on the flip side, you're paying these exorbitant consultation fees, 200 to $400 an hour if you can even find someone who's qualified. 

**Speaker 6:** So there's this cliff people fall off of after they get certified, 

**Speaker 5:** a post certification cliff. They get trained and then they're just abandoned. 

**Speaker 6:** So what's PTN Portal solution here?

This is use case 13. They're building a supervision marketplace. But it's not just a phone book. They're talking about using AI for diet matching. 

**Speaker 5:** Diet matching. Unpack that for me. 

**Speaker 6:** It means matching mentors and mentees based on compatibility, on style, on specific needs. It's like a dating app for professional supervision.

**Speaker 5:** Hmm. 

**Speaker 6:** Not just who is available at 2:00 PM but who works with the same modalities I do. 

**Speaker 5:** Who has experience with my patient population. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 5:** And they're also talking about supervision circles. Right? Groups of four to six practitioners, 

**Speaker 6:** which is brilliant economics. It lowers the cost for the individual, making it affordable while keeping the revenue high for the supervisor.

Uh, but from a business strategy perspective, this is genius because it creates a viral loop. 

**Speaker 5:** I love a good viral loop. 

**Speaker 6:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 5:** How does it work in this context? 

**Speaker 6:** Well, think about it. If I'm a supervisor on the platform, I would invite all my supervisees to join the platform. I essentially become a sales agent for PPM 

**Speaker 5:** and practitioners will invite their colleagues to their circle.

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. It turns the user base into a Salesforce, 

**Speaker 5:** plus they get to take a cut. The document mentions a 20% fee on supervision transactions. That is a completely new revenue stream that has nothing to do with software subscription. 

**Speaker 6:** Right. It diversifies the business model so they aren't just reliant on sauce fees.

**Speaker 5:** Okay. 


## Pain Point \#3 — Integration After Dosing: Using the Neuroplasticity Window (Use Case 14)

**Speaker 5:** Let's talk about the third bleeding neck pain point and this one. This one feels like a critique of the entire industry. The quote is, ketamine works really well, but the ketamine industry doesn't. 

**Speaker 6:** That is a brutal line, but it reflects a reality where clinics are just focused on drug delivery. 

**Speaker 5:** Yeah.

**Speaker 6:** You come in, you get your infusion, you leave the document notes that this leads to client churn rates of 60 to 70%. 

**Speaker 5:** That is massive churn. You're losing two thirds of your patients after the initial treatment 

**Speaker 6:** because they aren't getting the support they need to make the changes stick. The document talks about the neuroplasticity window.

**Speaker 5:** Right. Let's unpack that. This is the two to three weeks after a session. Yeah. 

**Speaker 6:** Yes. Biologically, the brain is more malleable during that time. It's the prime time to form new habits, change thought patterns, break old addictions. But currently that window is just being wasted. 

**Speaker 5:** So the clinic provides the drug, opens the window.

Then just walks away 

**Speaker 6:** effectively, yes, they're planting seeds, but forgetting to water them, and that's where use case 14 comes in. Integration tools. 

**Speaker 5:** What does that actually look like in the app? 

**Speaker 6:** It's things like, uh, automated homework templates, progress tracking and specific alerts for that neuroplasticity window.

Imagine the system automatically prompting the patient to journal three days post session. 

**Speaker 5:** Or flagging the therapist if the patient's mood score drops. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. It's about moving from, we give you a drug to, we are managing your transformation. 

**Speaker 5:** Financially, this is huge. The document says integration services can generate two to three times the revenue of the dosing sessions themselves, 

**Speaker 6:** which turns the economics of the clinic upside down in the best way.

Instead of constantly hunting for new patients, which is expensive. You're keeping your existing patients engaged and billing for the integration work. It reduces churn and increases lifetime value. 

**Speaker 5:** So those are the big three, workflow, isolation and integration, but the roadmap doesn't stop there. 


## Tier-One Add‑Ons: Liability Suite, Training Integration, and Multi‑Site Dashboards

**Speaker 5:** There's this section on tier one strategic add-ons that I found fascinating.

These aren't just daily annoyances. They address deep fears. 

**Speaker 6:** Fear is a great motivator and the biggest fear for any practitioner is liability use. Case seven is the liability protection suite. 

**Speaker 5:** The quote here is, if outcomes are inconsistent, I will be blamed. Or sued, 

**Speaker 6:** which is a valid fear in a new, you know, somewhat stigmatized industry.

So PPN is proposing audit ready documentation. The system would auto generate narrative charts and create a safety event. Chain of custody. 

**Speaker 5:** Chain of custody sounds very CSI. 

**Speaker 6:** It basically means immutable logs. If something goes wrong, you can prove exactly what you did when you did it, and that you followed protocol.

It's legal armor 

**Speaker 5:** and the barrier to entry here has to be high, right? You can't just code this over a weekend. 

**Speaker 6:** No, you need legal review. You need templates for different jurisdictions. That creates a moat. If PPN build this, it's very hard for a competitor to just copy it quickly. 

**Speaker 5:** Then there's use case eight training integration.

This seems like a play for the very beginning of the practitioner's journey. 

**Speaker 6:** It is. They want to integrate with state programs, specifically mentioning Colorado Dare I and Oregon, 

**Speaker 5:** which are the two big regulated markets right now. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. They wanna offer competency tracking and CEU credit systems directly in the platform.

But the growth strategy here is what's clever. They want to sell to cohorts. 

**Speaker 5:** So instead of selling to one doctor at a time, you sell to an entire training program, 

**Speaker 6:** right? You sell to a program for five or $10,000 a cohort. Suddenly you have 30 new practitioners who are trained on your software from day one.

**Speaker 5:** So by the time they graduate, they already know how to use PPN. 

**Speaker 6:** They aren't gonna go buy something else. It's the Adobe strategy. Get the students hooked 

**Speaker 5:** and quickly the last tier one add-on the multi-site dashboard. 

**Speaker 6:** This is for the big fish. The operators running 50 to hundred clinics. Their problem is they can't compare clinic A to clinic B.

PPN wants to build a dashboard that benchmarks them against each other. 

**Speaker 5:** So if clinic A is getting 20% better outcomes than clinic B, you wanna know why 

**Speaker 6:** exactly this tool tells you it brings the franchise model. To therapy. 


## Execution Roadmap 2026: Q1 Foundation, Q2 Hybrid Sprints, Q4 Insurance

**Speaker 5:** So we have the, the operating system. We have the why, the pain points. Now let's look at the when the execution roadmap for 2026, because ideas are cheap.

Execution is everything. 

**Speaker 6:** This is where the rubber meets the road. They've broken the year down into quarters 

**Speaker 5:** Q1, which is where we are now. Finish protocol builder and clinical intelligence, MVP. 

**Speaker 6:** This is the foundation. You have to have the data tools working before you can build the fancy stuff. They actually have a demo with a Dr.

Sheena coming up on Feb 15th, just a few days from now in the documents timeline. 

**Speaker 5:** Then Q2, April to June, this is where they make a critical decision. They're calling it the hybrid approach. 

**Speaker 6:** Yeah. This is interesting. They realize they can't just do one thing at a time. So the core team keeps building the intelligence platform, but the spinning up sprint teams to tackle the liability and training pain points simultaneously.

**Speaker 5:** So they're trying to move fast. They're parallel processing, 

**Speaker 6:** they have to, the voice of customer data is screaming that people are burning out. You can't tell a practitioner who's burning out, wait until Q4 for help. 

**Speaker 5:** They need to show progress now. 

**Speaker 6:** Right. And speaking of Q4, that is when they tackle insurance tools and integration.

**Speaker 5:** Ah, insurance. The whale. 

**Speaker 6:** The whale. It takes the longest to build, which is why it's later in the year. It's complex, bureaucratic, messy. But once you unlock insurance reimbursement. The market just explodes. 


## Build vs Buy: Partner for Commodities, Build the Moat Features

**Speaker 5:** One thing I noticed in the strategy section is the build versus buy philosophy. They aren't trying to build everything from scratch, are they?

**Speaker 6:** No, and that's crucial. If they tried to build their own video conferencing tool or their own billing processor, they'd fail. The strategy is build what differentiates partner for what is commoditized. 

**Speaker 5:** So use Calendly for scheduling. Use Stripe for billing. Use Twilio for messaging. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. Don't reinvent the wheel.

Just integrate the wheel into your car. 

**Speaker 5:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 6:** Things like the supervision marketplace or the liability templates, you have to build those yourself because that's where your unique value lies. 


## The Numbers: Doubling ARR with Platform Pricing \+ New Revenue Streams

**Speaker 5:** Let's talk numbers. The financial section. This is the argument for why this pivot is worth the risk. 

**Speaker 6:** It's a pretty stark comparison.

The current model selling, just the protocol builder, gets them to about 1.2 million in annual recurring revenue, 

**Speaker 5:** which isn't bad. It's a respectable small business. 

**Speaker 6:** It's fine. The expanded platform model. That projects out to 2.44 million. It literally doubles the revenue, 

**Speaker 5:** and that's coming from a mix of higher subscription fees, moving from $399 to $999 plus all these add-ons, 

**Speaker 6:** right?

Supervision fees, liability, add-ons, multi-site fees. And remember the strategic argument. A platform has a three x larger total addressable market. If you're a benchmarking tool, you only appeal to data-driven clinics. If you're the operating system, you appeal to everyone. 

**Speaker 5:** Plus the investor story is just so much better.

We are the OS for the industry is a much easier sell than we make a nice data entry form 

**Speaker 6:** 100%, and it justifies the platform decision. The document explicitly recommends the platform route. Because of that higher pricing power and the higher switching costs. Investors love a defensible business and a platform is much more defensible than a tool.


## Next Actions, Big Takeaway, and the Provocative ‘Platform as Regulator’ Question

**Speaker 5:** So what happens next? The document ends with immediate next actions for this week, February 12th to the 16th. 

**Speaker 6:** They're moving fast. The lead needs to get user approval on these use cases. This week, the designer is already supposed to be creating wire frames for the liability protection. 

**Speaker 5:** It feels urgent. 

**Speaker 6:** It is urgent.

They've identified that their strategic alignment is only 65% in the startup world. If you aren't aligned with your user's needs, you die. They're correcting the course in real time. 

**Speaker 5:** So let's wrap this up. What is the big takeaway here for our listeners? 

**Speaker 6:** The takeaway is that PPM portal is realizing that data is not enough.

You can have the best data in the world, but if the practitioner is burning out from administrative chaos. The data doesn't matter. They're moving from a tool that tracks therapy to a system that enables the business of therapy. Yeah. It's a shift from the theoretical to the practical. 

**Speaker 5:** Exactly. By addressing the unsexy problems, billing, liability, scheduling.

They're actually. Unlocking the ability to improve clinical outcomes. You can't have good integration therapy if your system doesn't remind the patient to do their homework. 

**Speaker 6:** It reminds me of that saying, amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics. This roadmap is all about logistics. It's about the plumbing that makes the house livable.

**Speaker 5:** Here's my provocative closing thought for you. If this platform succeeds. If PPN becomes the operating system for everyone, they handle the training, the liability, the supervision, the data, do they eventually become the primary regulator of the industry by default? 

**Speaker 6:** That's a fascinating question. 

**Speaker 5:** I mean, if they hold all the data and set the verification standards for who gets to be on the platform, 

**Speaker 6:** yeah, 

**Speaker 5:** they might have more power than the state boards.

**Speaker 6:** If you get kicked off the platform, you might effectively be out of business. Yeah. In a fragmented industry, the platform that organizes the chaos often becomes the defacto law. If PPN sets the standard for what a safe session looks like in their code, that becomes the industry standard. It's definitely a possibility, 

**Speaker 5:** something to chew on, power flows to the platform.


## Closing: The Future of Psychedelic Practice and What Comes Next

**Speaker 5:** That's it for this deep dive into the PPN Portal roadmap. Thanks for joining us on this journey into the future of psychedelic practice. 

**Speaker 6:** Always a pleasure. 

**Speaker 5:** We'll see you next time.
