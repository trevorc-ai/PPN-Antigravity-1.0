# Scaling\_Psychedelic\_Therapy\_Without\_Patient\_Names


## Psychedelic Mental Health ‘Gold Rush’—Hype vs. Reality

**Speaker 9:** If you look at the headlines coming outta the mental health space right now, yeah. You get this, this just overwhelming sense of momentum. It feels like a revolution. 

**Speaker 10:** Oh, absolutely. It definitely feels like a gold rush. 

**Speaker 9:** You have ketamine, clinics popping up in strip malls. Psilocybin is legal and running in Oregon.

MDMA is knocking on the FDA's door from the outside. It looks like we've finally cracked the code. 

**Speaker 10:** It does. There's a lot of energy, a lot of capital, and you know, a lot of hope. 

**Speaker 9:** But that's the view from 30,000 feet. 


## The Wild West Problem: 3,500 Clinics, Zero Shared Outcomes

**Speaker 9:** When you actually land on the ground and look at the sources we have today, a pitch deck and memos for a platform called the PPN Research Portal.

You realize the foundation of this revolution is well, incredibly shaky, right? We're looking at something like 3,500 interventional mood treatment sites in the US alone. That is a massive number. Yeah, but do you know what the aggregate data says about what those 3,500 clinics are actually doing? 

**Speaker 10:** The short answer is nobody knows.

**Speaker 9:** That's terrifying. 

**Speaker 10:** It is the definition of fragmentation, and the sources describe this current landscape, not as a well-oiled machine, but as the Wild West. 

**Speaker 9:** The wild west, 

**Speaker 10:** you have thousands of practitioners all operating on their own little islands. They're developing their own protocols, using their own intuition, and essentially guessing at best practices because they just aren't sharing notes.

**Speaker 9:** There's a quote in here from a Dr. Sheena jar. She runs the Ben Ketamine clinic and she puts it bluntly. She says, research progress is hampered by lack of comparable data. 

**Speaker 10:** That's a very polite way of saying we're flying blind. I mean, think about it. If Dr. Ger Milow finds a specific dosing protocol that works perfectly for, say, a 40-year-old male with treatment resistant depression, the clinic down the street has absolutely no way of knowing that they might be using a protocol that failed five years ago.

**Speaker 9:** So everyone is reinventing the wheel. Every single day. 

**Speaker 10:** Ah, 

**Speaker 9:** in every single clinic. 

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. And that inefficiency isn't just annoying, it's dangerous, it slows down progress, and it leads to suboptimal care. 


## PPN Research Portal: ‘See What Works Before You Treat’

**Speaker 10:** And that is the core problem the PPN research portal is designed to solve. 

**Speaker 9:** And their mission statement is pretty clear.

See what works. Before you treat, 

**Speaker 10:** that tagline is doing a lot of heavy lifting. It signals a shift from treating psychedelic therapy as an art, where a doctor just kind of feels it out 

**Speaker 9:** based on vibes, 

**Speaker 10:** right? Based on vibes to a hard data-driven science. 

**Speaker 9:** So today we're gonna unpack three specific pillars of their strategy.

First, we have to talk about the interface itself, something they call the split screen, which completely changes the timeline of how a doctor makes a decision. 

**Speaker 10:** It moves them from being reactive to being perspective. 

**Speaker 9:** Second, we need to look at their data strategy. It is incredibly counterintuitive in an age where everyone wants your data.

PPN is deliberately refusing to collect patient names or identifiers, 

**Speaker 10:** and this isn't just for privacy. It's actually a brilliant legal and competitive maneuver. 

**Speaker 9:** It's arguably the smartest part of the whole model. 

**Speaker 10:** I'd agree. 

**Speaker 9:** And finally, the network effect. How do you take a field that moves at. Let's be honest to glacial pace and speed it up by maybe 10 or 20 years.

**Speaker 10:** Hmm. 


## Status Quo Breakdown: Retroactive Logging & Rearview-Mirror Care

**Speaker 9:** So let's start with that immediate problem, the timeline of care. 

**Speaker 10:** Right? To understand why PPN is different, you have to understand the status quo. The documents refer to the current standard as. Retroactive logging, 

**Speaker 9:** which just sounds like homework. 

**Speaker 10:** It basically is, imagine you're a doctor. You have a patient sitting in the chair.

You have to make a decision on the spot, let's say 60 milligrams of ketamine via fee. You administer it, the patient goes home, and then maybe a week later, or at the end of the day, you log those results into your electronic health record, your EHR, 

**Speaker 9:** you're just typing into a void. 

**Speaker 10:** Essentially you're creating a record of what happened, but that record didn't help you make the decision in the moment.

The needle is already out of the arm. The opportunity to optimize that treatment is gone. 

**Speaker 9:** You're driving the car by looking in the rear view mirror. 

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 9:** So PPN is trying to flip that mirror around. They call it prospective intelligence. 


## The Split-Screen Demo: Real-Time Decision Support in the Intake

**Speaker 10:** And the visual for this is the split screen. 

**Speaker 9:** Okay, let's visualize this for you.

The slide on the deck literally shows a computer monitor. Just cut right down the middle. 

**Speaker 10:** On the left side, you have practitioner inputs. This is the present moment. The doctor's doing the intake. They're typing in the patient profile. 

**Speaker 9:** Let's play this out. Let's use a specific scenario because the idea is cool, but I wanna know what it looks like in practice.

Let's say I'm a doctor, new patient, male, 42 years old. Major depressive disorder weighs about, um. 75 kilograms. 

**Speaker 10:** Okay. Pretty standard profile. The doctor types that in on the left. 

**Speaker 9:** Well, let's add a wrinkle. Let's say this patient is currently taking one milligram of clonazepam daily for anxiety. That's a benzodiazepine.

**Speaker 10:** That is a crucial detail. So the doctor types clonazepam one milligram on the left side. 

**Speaker 9:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 10:** As they're typing the right side of the screen, which is labeled live data intelligence is updating in real time. It's filtering the entire network's history to find matches for that specific profile. 

**Speaker 9:** So before the doctor even finishes the sentence.

The system is crunching the numbers from thousands of other cases. 

**Speaker 10:** Correct. And it might pop up and say, similar patients in network N one two A seven, and right underneath that a benchmark 68% significant improvement. 

**Speaker 9:** So right off the bat you aren't guessing, you know the statistical odds of success. For a person who looks just like this, 


## Safety \+ Biology in Context: Benzos, Efficacy Drops, Better Protocols

**Speaker 10:** but here's where the decision support gets really granular.

You mentioned the clonazepam. In a standard clinic, a doctor might just think, okay, anxiety meds, that's fine. We'll just proceed. 

**Speaker 9:** But the PPN system flags it. 

**Speaker 10:** It flashes a safety alert on the right side. Something like benzodiazepines may reduce efficacy by 23%. 

**Speaker 9:** Wow. That is a massive drop. You're losing a quarter of the benefit before you even start, 

**Speaker 10:** and the system even explains why.

The deck mentions these visualizations for receptor impact. It can show that ketamine works by creating a glutamatergic surge. It excites the neurons. Benzodiazepines do the exact opposite. They dampen neuronal activity. They literally fight the treatment. 

**Speaker 9:** So the system isn't just saying, don't do it. 

**Speaker 10:** Mm.

**Speaker 9:** It is showing the biology. It's saying if you do this, you are pressing the gas and the brake at the exact same time. 

**Speaker 10:** Precisely. And then it offers a protocol suggestion. Consider holding benzodiazepine for 24 hours prior to treatment. 

**Speaker 9:** That is the difference between a wasted session and a breakthrough.

And the key is that this all happens before the treatment. 

**Speaker 10:** That's the perspective part. It turns the doctor from a lone wolf, you know, relying on their gut into a node in a massive network. They have the collective intelligence of every other doctor right there on the screen. 


## Benchmarking Clinics: Network Averages, Quality Loops, ‘Commoditizing Excellence’

**Speaker 9:** It also brings up a competitive angle that I found really interesting.

The deck mentions network benchmarks. 

**Speaker 10:** Ah, yes. This is the part that might make some doctors a little uncomfortable, but it's vital for the industry. The system shows your clinic's success rate right next to the network average. 

**Speaker 9:** So if my clinic is getting 50% results with these kinds of patients, and the network is averaging 70%.

**Speaker 10:** You know immediately that you are doing something wrong. You can't hide from the data. It forces a quality improvement loop, 

**Speaker 9:** which might be stressful for the doctor. But if I'm a patient, that is exactly what I want. I want my doctor to know they're underperforming so they can fix it. 

**Speaker 10:** It commoditizes excellence.

It makes high performance the standard, not the exception. 


## The No-PHI Data Strategy: Privacy, Cost, and Breach-Proofing

**Speaker 9:** So to build a system like this that can tell you that benzos reduce efficacy by 23%, you need data, you need a lot of it, 

**Speaker 10:** a staggering amount. 

**Speaker 9:** And usually in the tech world, when a company says, give us all your data, we get skeptical. We think about surveillance, about ad targeting, 

**Speaker 10:** and in healthcare it's even stickier because of hyper.

**Speaker 9:** But PPN has taken a completely different route, and I have to admit, when I first read the no PHI memo, I thought I was misreading it. Their strategy is to collect zero personal information, 

**Speaker 10:** right? No names, no addresses, no birth dates, no social security numbers, nothing that can identify you as a human being.

**Speaker 9:** So yeah. Why? In a world where data is the new oil, why would you deliberately refuse to drill? For the most valuable part, the user's identity, 

**Speaker 10:** it's a fascinating strategic choice. It comes down to two things, defensive costs and offensive freedom. 

**Speaker 9:** Let's talk about the cost first. 

**Speaker 10:** The memo breaks this down pretty clearly.

To be hyper compliant, to legally hold that patient data costs a startup about half a million dollars a year. You need compliance officers, secure servers, complex audits. It's heavy infrastructure, 

**Speaker 9:** and that's just the cost of doing business. That doesn't even include the risk of messing up 

**Speaker 10:** and that risk is existential.

The average healthcare data breach to liability is over $10 million. If you're a startup and you leak patient records, especially records involving mental health and you know, psychedelic drug use, you are done. You're finished. 

**Speaker 9:** So, PPN looked at this and said, if we don't hold the toxic asset, the identity, we don't have the risk.

Their compliance cost is zero 

**Speaker 10:** and their breach risk is effectively zero. If hackers broke into PPN tomorrow, all they'd find is a bunch of numbers and drug dosages. They wouldn't know who subject 1 23 is. 

**Speaker 9:** That's the defense. 


## Blue Ocean Advantage: De-Identified Data That Competitors Can’t Share

**Speaker 9:** But you mentioned offensive freedom. This connects to what they call their Blue ocean strategy.

**Speaker 10:** This is the really clever part. PPN has competitors. Of course there are companies like Osmond, but Osmond is an electronic health record system, an EHR. They have to hold the names 'cause they handle billing and scheduling. They need to know where to send the invoice. 

**Speaker 9:** They're the digital file cabinet.

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. But because they're the file cabinet, they are legally locked inside the office. ICA makes it incredibly difficult to share that data between clinics. You can't just take patient a's data from a clinic in New York and compare it to patient B in California without a mountain of legal hurdles. 

**Speaker 9:** So Osmond has the data, but it's siloed, it's trapped.

**Speaker 10:** PPN, because they strip the identifiers at the source. The data is legally considered, de-identified. It's fluid. They can aggregate data from a thousand different clinics into one giant pool without breaking a single law. 

**Speaker 9:** That's the moat. They can build a data set that their competitors are legally forbidden from building.

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. Osmond literally isn't allowed to do what PPN is doing because they know too much about the patient. 


## Hashed Subject IDs & Small-Cell Suppression: Longitudinal Tracking Without Names

**Speaker 9:** But I have to play devil's advocate here. If they don't know who the patient is, how is the tool useful over time? I mean, mental health isn't a one-time thing. If I come in for six sessions over six months, how does the system know that Session six is the same person as session one?

**Speaker 10:** That is the technical hurdle. They had to clear, they solved it with something called hashed subject IDs, 

**Speaker 9:** hashed IDs. Okay, break that down for us. 

**Speaker 10:** Think of it like a secret code generator. When the doctor enters the patient's info locally, say clinic ID plus initials, plus birth year, the software runs it through an algorithm, a hash function, 

**Speaker 9:** and that algorithm just spits out a code, 

**Speaker 10:** right?

A unique string of characters, let's say subject X nine, Y two. Every time that doctor enters those same details for that patient, the system generates the exact same code so the doctor can track their patient's progress over months. 

**Speaker 9:** But PPN. On their end, 

**Speaker 10:** PPN only ever sees subject X nine Y two. They can't reverse engineer the code to get the name back.

It allows for longitudinal tracking following the patient through time without the surveillance. 

**Speaker 9:** It's a really clever workaround. It preserves the science, but ditches the liability. 

**Speaker 10:** And to be extra safe, they use something called small cell suppression. If there are fewer than 10 people in a very specific category, you know, left-handed banjo players in Iowa, the system just hides the data.

**Speaker 9:** So you can't accidentally identify someone just because they're unique. 

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. Anonymity is mathematically guaranteed. Hmm. 


## Network Effects: From 17 Years of Data to 17 Months

**Speaker 9:** This brings us to the bigger picture. We've got the interface, we've got the privacy strategy, but the ultimate goal here is speed. The sources talk about the network effect and they compare their mission to the work of a Dr.

James Fatman. 

**Speaker 10:** Dr. Fatman is a legend in the psychedelic underground. For years long before this stuff was mainstream or legal, he was collecting data on microdosing, 

**Speaker 9:** but not through a hospital or university. 

**Speaker 10:** No, he couldn't. It was illegal. He did it all through a website. People would self-report. I took this much, I felt this way.

He spent 17 years building that dataset. He proved two things. First, that systematic data collection works, and second, that people will participate if they feel safe and anonymous. 

**Speaker 9:** 17 years is a long time to wait for answers. 

**Speaker 10:** PPNs pitch is basically, we wanna do what Fatman did in 17 years, but in 17 months, 

**Speaker 9:** and that's where the network effect kicks in.

**Speaker 10:** It's the classic flywheel concept in week one. The platform is frankly not that useful. Maybe you have 50 patients in the system, the predictions are fuzzy. 

**Speaker 9:** The cold start problem, 

**Speaker 10:** right? But fast forward to year two. Now imagine you have 5,000 patients. The predictions become scary, accurate. The safety alerts like for that benzodiazepine interaction are potentially saving lives.

The tool becomes indispensable 

**Speaker 9:** and the more indispensable it is, the more doctors sign up 

**Speaker 10:** and the more doctors sign up, the better the data gets. It just spirals upward, 

**Speaker 9:** and once that flywheel is spinning, it's very hard for a competitor to catch up. 

**Speaker 10:** That is the defensibility. If PPN reaches 1000 distinct protocols, first they become the industry standard.

It creates a defensive advantage that lasts for a decade. It's the same playbook, 23, and Me used. 

**Speaker 9:** I remember when 23 Emmy launched, everyone thought they were a novelty gift company. You'd buy the kit for your uncle, 

**Speaker 10:** right? But 23 and E didn't make its real value selling $99 spit kits. They built a multi-billion dollar valuation because they had the largest structured database of genetic information in the world.

**Speaker 9:** The aggregation is the product 

**Speaker 10:** precisely. They sold the insights, not the kits. PPN is doing the same thing, but for clinical outcomes, 


## Business Model & Legal Positioning: $999/mo, DEA Risk, ‘Quality Improvement’

**Speaker 9:** which brings us to the business model because unlike 23 and me, this isn't a consumer product. They're selling this to clinics and the price tag mentioned the deck is.

Bold, 

**Speaker 10:** very bold. 

**Speaker 9:** $999 per site per month, 

**Speaker 10:** a thousand dollars a month. It's a lot, 

**Speaker 9:** especially when you consider that most software these doctors use for scheduling for basic notes costs maybe 50 or a hundred dollars a month. 

**Speaker 10:** It is a steep jump, but PPN argues that you aren't paying for software, you are paying for clinical decision support.

**Speaker 9:** What's the difference in value there? 

**Speaker 10:** Well, think about the cost of a bad decision. 

**Speaker 9:** Hmm. 

**Speaker 10:** If a doctor mistreats a patient because they didn't know about that drug interaction, the patient doesn't get better. The clinic loses a customer, maybe they face a lawsuit, or maybe the doctor just burns out from the stress of constantly guessing.

**Speaker 9:** So the a thousand dollars is basically an insurance policy against incompetence. 

**Speaker 10:** It's the, am I doing this right tax? This is a new field. Practitioners are anxious. They're working with powerful substances, paying a premium to have the collective brain power of the entire network guiding your hand. For a lot of them, that peace of mind is a bargain.

**Speaker 9:** It also positions them really interestingly with the law. We touched on this, but ketamine is legal. Psilocybin and MDMA are. Not so much, at least not federally. 

**Speaker 10:** And that is the other reason. The no PHI thing is so vital. If you are a company holding a list of names of people using schedule ice substances, you are painting a massive target on your back.

For the DEA, 

**Speaker 9:** they're holding a confession list 

**Speaker 10:** exactly. By collecting no identifiers. PPN avoids that federal exposure. They position the tool not as medical research, which requires FDA approval, but as. Quality improvement. 

**Speaker 9:** Quality improvement sounds like a semantic trick. 

**Speaker 10:** It's a very specific legal definition.

Quality improvement is internal benchmarking. It's allowed, it lets them start with ketamine, then move into Oregon psilocybin services and eventually into MDMA, all while staying in a safe legal harbor. 


## Endgame Vision: A Never-Ending, Real-World Decentralized Clinical Trial

**Speaker 9:** So what's the end game here? Five years down the road. Does PPN just want to be a software company? 

**Speaker 10:** I don't think so.

The vision in the deck is much bigger. They want to change how medical research is done fundamentally. 

**Speaker 9:** How so? 

**Speaker 10:** Right now, clinical trials are artificial. You recruit a hundred people, you put them in a sterile lab, you filter out anyone with complex issues and you watch 'em for a year. It's slow, it's expensive, and it doesn't really reflect the real world.

**Speaker 9:** Because in the real world, patients are messy. They have anxiety, they take other meds. 

**Speaker 10:** Exactly. PPN wants to turn every single clinical encounter in the real world into a data point. They wanna run a massive, decentralized clinical trial that never, ever ends. 

**Speaker 9:** So if I go to a clinic in Ohio on a Tuesday. My data helps a patient in London on a Friday.

**Speaker 10:** Instantly it accelerates the feedback loop from decades to days. 

**Speaker 9:** It's taking the concept of the hive mine and applying it directly to medicine. 

**Speaker 10:** And in a field like psychedelics, which is so subjective, so variable that hive mine might be the only way we ever really understand what's going on. 

**Speaker 9:** It's a fascinating shift.

We usually think that to get better healthcare, we need to get more personal. We need the doctor to know us deeply. 

**Speaker 10:** But PPN suggests the opposite approach to data, 

**Speaker 9:** right? They're suggesting that maybe the best way to advance medicine is to know less about the patient, their identity, their name, so we can understand more about the treatment 

**Speaker 10:** anonymity as the key to precision.

It's a wild thought, but the logic really does hold up. 

**Speaker 9:** It definitely gives you something to think about. 


## Wrap-Up: The Infrastructure the Psychedelic Wild West Needs

**Speaker 9:** That's a wrap on our deep dive into the PPN Research portal. It's a complex mix of tech law and pharmacology, but it might just be the infrastructure this wild west needs. Thanks for listening. 

**Speaker 10:** See you next time.
