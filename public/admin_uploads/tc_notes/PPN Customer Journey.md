Emotional State: Curious, cautiously optimistic, evaluating credibility

Stage 2: Evaluation 📊  
Decision-Making Process  
User Questions at This Stage:

"Is this legitimate and secure?" ✅ ANSWERED (HIPAA, encryption, institutional backing)  
"Will this actually save me time?" ⚠️ PARTIALLY ANSWERED (features shown, but ROI unclear)  
"How much does it cost?" ❌ NOT ANSWERED

Getting to First Value  
Critical Activation Milestones:

Log First Protocol \- Primary activation event  
View First Safety Alert \- Experience core value prop  
Compare to Network Benchmark \- See competitive positioning

⚠️ No mobile optimization \- Practitioners often work on tablets  
Time to First Value:

Current: \~15-30 minutes (signup → first protocol logged)  
Industry Benchmark: Should be \<10 minutes for SaaS activation  
Opportunity: Reduce to \<5 minutes with pre-filled demo protocol  
Activation Metrics to Track:

% of users who log first protocol within 24 hours  
% of users who log first protocol within 7 days  
Average time from signup to first protocol  
% of users who return after first protocol  
Emotional State: Cautiously engaged, seeking validation that this was worth the effort

Stage 5: Retention 🔄  
Building Habitual Usage  
Current Retention Drivers:
