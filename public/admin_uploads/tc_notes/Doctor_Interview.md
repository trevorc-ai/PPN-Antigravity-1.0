Psychedelic Therapy Doctor Interview
Doctor: Substance, but we're gonna find that peak. We're gonna find that plateau, and we're gonna ride it out for as long as it's pharmacologically comfortable for them. Okay? And then we might introduce another agent to switch directions so that they're getting closer to their goal. That whole gray area variable, a lot of things can happen, and that's where the.
Art comes in 
Trevor: Sure. The subjective part. 'cause you don't even know if they're describing it, if they're articulate. But, but in all other senses, it, it's a, a pretty standard medical monitoring scenario. 
Doctor: Yeah. The monitoring is pretty standard. 
Trevor: Okay. And then what, what sort of when you get into the art how do you standardize that?
Even for yourself or, or, you know, like, are, are you using. Some sort of widely accepted scoring. Ben, 
Doctor: we aren't, we aren't. Some other people might one, we're a small team, so we'll we'll go with, we'll see who has better rapport with the individual and then we'll often intuit with each other or with the person.
And we come to, we al we almost always come to an agreement or somebody has an overriding, I know where they need to go. Someone may have been in for the fourth time and they haven't had a breakthrough. And we're at a point where we're like, okay, we're gonna do one milligram per kilogram of ketamine. I am, and we're gonna get a breakthrough and we'll agree on that.
So we're not using a form, we're using we're using a Venn diagram of. Qualitative, quantitative and intuitive information and the qualitative and intuitive come from the collection of our personal experiences. 
Trevor: Okay. All right. Okay. I I think you're gonna be excited about what we have to see. And, and if you've seen anything, it, it's, that was very crude.
Jason: Yeah, it's, it's been a while. It's, it's something. 
Trevor: So is there anything else that you, you know, like, pretend this is your wishlist and for, not just for me or for yourself or your own practice, but for your community you mentioned, you know. A standardization of inputs. You you mentioned a couple things.
What else? 
Doctor: Well, there, then we're gonna get into some serious caveats that do come up. Somebody has had somebody is 175 pounds and they've been given 125 milligrams of MBMA as a starter dose after a 20 milligram test dose. Not having a breakthrough. Then we give then we decide to give a per rectal 125 milligrams.
So we've got 'em up to say, 250 milligrams of MBMA. They're just not breaking through. Then we get into some pharmacodynamic questions where I want to plug in. Okay. Respiratory radi is 16, heart rate is 1 22, and their baseline was 84. You know, not crazy tachycardia. Not crazy diaphoretic. Should we.
What's the next best move here? A breakthrough? If I add 75 milligrams of ketamine intramuscular right now, am I gonna affect MDMA receptors too much or is there a sign I should be looking for? These are nuances and these are things that they come in handy. 'cause we're on the fly. We're on the fly because we're not doing tribal.
We've got a week, we've got sunset, we've got singing, dancing, we've got whatever we've got. We're in a clinical setting. We've got a limited period of time for people who are looking for something very specific. 
Trevor: It's, and it's time. So, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Time timed monitoring down to the minute, down to the second 
Doctor: hours.
Trevor: Down to the hour. 
Doctor: Yeah. I mean, we're, our, our, our agreement with people is we have them for as long as they need to be, but with trifecta, for example, anything other than iboga they're gonna, they're, they're gonna be out within eight hours. Okay. Some people are gonna be in their, have their entire experience in four.
And some people might not have anything significant until hour six, and the last two are, are seriously productive. But we do get into quagmire where somebody isn't having breakthrough or they've gone a little bit too far. 
Trevor: What about safety for the practitioners or for the patients? Worst case scenarios.
Like what, what would be some got, you know, like. Kind of the outliers of it doesn't happen very often, but it would be really nice if we could prevent it or share when it does. Any, any examples of 
Doctor: that. This s serotonin syndrome could or could theoretically arise. And we're prepared to have injectable cyclo, hexidine magnesium.
We keep an IV line available continuing on a worst case scenario in our setting. We can intubate if we have to. We monitor with, I began EKG. At baseline and then every few hours particularly the QT interval, anything over 500 we're looking at continuously after that. And we can, we haven't had to, but with AFib, we could we could cardiovert if we had to, we could defibrillate if we had to.
We, so in our situation we're, we're outpatient critical care. 
Trevor: Okay. And would you say that that is common? 
Doctor: Extremely uncommon. 
Trevor: Okay. 
Doctor: And for the most part, knock on wood, not necessary. 
Trevor: Right? 
Doctor: But the level of under, particularly with igan, it, the risk is too high because of the 33 reported deaths in the past a hundred years of non-medically monitored.
Yeah, highly unlikely to happen. But given the nature of the, the risk and exposure of the practitioners, that is, it's what our, we have decided to do. 
Trevor: We can mitigate that risk if they can show that they've been practicing diligent medical care in terms of like, you know, criminal liability or malpractice.
Okay, 
Doctor: well, Trevor, that's wrong. I mean, if you're giving somebody a, a schedule one substance, you're breaking the law. 
Trevor: Oh, I, I meant in the context of if, if it was legal. 
Doctor: Oh, none of these things we're talking about are legal. Oh, 
Trevor: okay. Okay. Okay. These are these, this is good. This is very good information. And
that's all I have. 
Doctor: That's it. Well, we have a last minute add-on starting late tonight. 
Trevor: What's that? It 
Doctor: would be great to get a, to get a template to work with for this session. 
Trevor: I, I'm not sure I understand. Say it again. 
Doctor: Do you have a working template, a beta version to plug some information into, see what it looks like in real world, 
Trevor: By tonight potentially?
Not, not with what you're talking about, but because I do have it over time, but I haven't built in the I mean, well, it's partly there, the 
Jason: import, 
Trevor: but, but the, no, it's but the. Down to the minute, say like, timestamp, trekking. So we're, but so, 
Jason: so there's basic stuff there, but not to the level that you just reviewed.
Trevor: It, the, the framework is there. 
Jason: Right. 
Trevor: But what you, what you're talking about is more than just XY, right? It's X, Y, Z, Z. Yeah. And, and Q let's start 
Jason: somewhere. 
Trevor: So it's MD and ma. Okay. I, I, i, I have no other questions. We're, I think we're gonna get cut off. I pay for Google Meet. I don't know if you are are comfortable with Google Meet normally.
I could use that and we could talk as long as we want, but I think Zoom's gonna cut me off 'cause I, I hate Zoom. 
Jason: We've got a few minutes, 
Trevor: but if, if, if I wanted to text or call or email or anything, are you, you know, I won't bother you, but I, I may have a follow up question. 
Doctor: Text would be great. I can respond as I'm able.
Trevor: Okay. Anything, any questions for me? 
Doctor: So many, but let's just see where we go from 
Jason: there. So we, we did talk about potentially meeting for a little bit tomorrow. I'm wondering if one, we need you to do that and if we do that, if we could have something maybe forum wise to, I don't know, Trevor, on the process.
Trevor: I, one thing you'll learn about me is I never over promise. I so 
Jason: over deliver. 
Trevor: I, I, and, and I have to fight my, my overachiever perfectionism. So but
damn it.
