4\. FAQ Section  
Pricing & Billing  
Q: Is there a free trial?  
A: Yes\! All plans include a 14-day free trial with full access to features. No credit card required to start.

Q: Can I switch plans later?  
A: Absolutely. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately; downgrades take effect at the end of your billing cycle.

Q: What payment methods do you accept?  
A: We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover) and ACH transfers for annual plans.

Q: Do you offer discounts for annual billing?  
A: Yes\! Save 20% with annual billing. Solo: $948/year (vs. $1,188), Clinic: $4,788/year (vs. $5,988).

Q: What happens if I exceed my user or site limits?  
A: For Clinic plans, you can add users ($40/mo each) or sites ($100/mo each) at any time. For Enterprise needs, contact us for custom pricing.

Security & Compliance  
Q: Is PPN HIPAA-compliant?  
A: Yes. PPN is fully HIPAA-compliant with bank-level encryption (AES-256), SOC 2 Type II certification, and signed Business Associate Agreements (BAA) for all customers.

Q: Where is my data stored?  
A: All data is stored in secure, HIPAA-compliant data centers in the United States (AWS US-East). We never store PHI outside the US.

Q: Can I export my data?  
A: Yes. All plans include data export (CSV). Clinic and Enterprise plans include scheduled exports and custom formats.

Q: What happens to my data if I cancel?  
A: You retain full access to your data for 30 days after cancellation. You can export all data during this period. After 30 days, data is permanently deleted per HIPAA requirements.

Features & Functionality  
Q: Can I import existing data?  
A: Yes. We provide a CSV import template for historical protocols. Enterprise customers get dedicated migration support.

Q: Do you integrate with my EHR?  
A: Enterprise plans include API access for custom integrations. We have existing integrations with \[list common EHRs if applicable\]. Contact us to discuss your specific needs.

Q: Is there a mobile app?  
A: PPN is fully mobile-responsive and works on all devices. A Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline logging is coming in Q2 2026\.

Q: Can I customize the platform for my clinic?  
A: Enterprise plans include white-labeling for patient-facing reports and custom analytics dashboards. Contact us to discuss your requirements.

Support & Onboarding  
Q: How long does onboarding take?  
A: Most solo practitioners are logging protocols within 10 minutes. Clinic plans include a 1-hour onboarding call. Enterprise customers get custom training programs.

Q: What support is included?  
A: Solo: Email support (24-hour response). Clinic: Priority email support (4-hour response) \+ onboarding call. Enterprise: 24/7 support \+ dedicated account manager.

Q: Do you offer training for my team?  
A: Yes. Clinic plans include 1-hour onboarding. Enterprise plans include custom training programs, video tutorials, and ongoing education.

Objection Handling  
Q: I'm already using spreadsheets. Why should I switch?  
A: Spreadsheets can't catch dangerous drug interactions, benchmark your outcomes against the network, or ensure HIPAA compliance. PPN users save an average of 5 hours per week and reduce safety incidents by 40%. \[See ROI Calculator →\]

Q: This seems expensive for a solo practitioner.  
A: At $99/mo, PPN costs less than 1 therapy session. If it saves you just 1 hour per week (valued at $150+), you're ahead by $500/month. Plus, the safety features alone are priceless. \[Try free for 14 days →\]

Q: What if my clinic is too small for the Clinic plan?  
A: Start with Solo and upgrade when you're ready. Many clinics start with one account and upgrade within 3 months as they see the value.

Q: I'm concerned about data security.  
A: We take security seriously. PPN is HIPAA-compliant, SOC 2 certified, and uses the same encryption as major banks. We've never had a data breach. \[Read Security Overview →\]

A: Yes. We provide a CSV import template for historical protocols. Enterprise customers get dedicated migration support.

---

### Objection Handling

Q: I'm already using spreadsheets. Why should I switch?  
A: Spreadsheets can't catch dangerous drug interactions, benchmark your outcomes against the network, or ensure HIPAA compliance. PPN users save an average of 5 hours per week and reduce safety incidents by 40%. \[See ROI Calculator →\]  
Q: This seems expensive for a solo practitioner.  
A: At $99/mo, PPN costs less than 1 therapy session. If it saves you just 1 hour per week (valued at $150+), you're ahead by $500/month. Plus, the safety features alone are priceless. \[Try free for 14 days →\]  
Q: What if my clinic is too small for the Clinic plan?  
A: Start with Solo and upgrade when you're ready. Many clinics start with one account and upgrade within 3 months as they see the value.  
Q: I'm concerned about data security.  
A: We take security seriously. PPN is HIPAA-compliant, SOC 2 certified, and uses the same encryption as major banks. We've never had a data breach. \[Read Security Overview →\]

### Psychological Triggers

1. Anchoring: Show annual pricing with "Save 20%" badge  
2. Social Proof: "840+ clinicians trust PPN" \+ case study quotes  
3. Scarcity: "Limited spots for Enterprise onboarding in Q1 2026"  
4. Risk Reversal: "14-day free trial, no credit card required"  
5. Authority: "HIPAA-compliant, SOC 2 certified, trusted by research institutions"

---

### A/B Testing Plan

Test 1: Pricing Display

* Variant A: Monthly pricing (default)  
* Variant B: Annual pricing (default)  
* Hypothesis: Annual pricing increases LTV and reduces churn

Test 2: CTA Copy

* Variant A: "Start Free Trial"  
* Variant B: "Try PPN Free for 14 Days"  
* Hypothesis: Specific duration increases conversion

Test 3: Feature Emphasis

* Variant A: Safety features first  
* Variant B: Time savings first  
* Hypothesis: Different personas respond to different value props

Test 4: Social Proof

* Variant A: Practitioner count ("840+ clinicians")  
* Variant B: Protocol count ("12,000+ protocols logged")  
* Hypothesis: Protocol count is more tangible
