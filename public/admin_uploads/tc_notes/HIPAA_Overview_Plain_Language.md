# PPN Portal & HIPAA — The Plain Language Overview
*February 23, 2026 | For advisors, partners, and investors*

---

## The Short Answer

**PPN Portal is designed so that HIPAA does not apply to it.**

Not because we found a loophole. Because we built the platform in a way that makes
it structurally impossible for HIPAA to apply — by never collecting the type of
information that HIPAA regulates in the first place.

---

## What HIPAA Actually Protects

HIPAA protects **Protected Health Information (PHI)** — information that can
identify a specific person *and* relates to their health, treatment, or payment.

Classic examples of PHI:
- "Jane Doe, age 42, received ketamine treatment on March 5th"
- "Patient #847 at Denver Ketamine Clinic was diagnosed with PTSD"
- "John Smith's insurance was billed $600 for an infusion"

HIPAA exists because this kind of identified health data — if leaked or subpoenaed
— can harm real people.

## What PPN Portal Actually Stores

PPN Portal stores clinical records that look like this:

> Session ID: `a7f3d92c...`
> Subject: `8b4e1209...` *(an indecipherable code)*
> Substance code: `14` *(a number from a reference table)*
> Dosage: `0.5` *(milligrams per kilogram)*
> Heart rate: `84` *(beats per minute)*
> Outcome score: `7` *(a PHQ-9 number)*

There is no name. No date of birth. No address. No diagnosis in plain language.
No insurance ID. No way to tell who this person is, which clinic they visited,
or even which city they live in.

The "indecipherable code" for the patient is generated by a one-way
cryptographic process — like a fingerprint shredder. The clinic knows which
patient it corresponds to. PPN Portal never does, and never can.

---

## Why This Matters Legally

HIPAA only applies to information that **identifies** (or could reasonably
be used to identify) a specific person. If the information is truly
de-identified, HIPAA simply does not apply to it.

PPN Portal's records are not just anonymized by policy — they are
anonymized by architecture. There are no fields in the database
for a patient's name. There is no way to enter one. Even if a practitioner
tried, the system has nowhere to put it.

**The result:** What PPN Portal stores is not PHI. And because it doesn't
handle PHI, HIPAA's compliance requirements — the expensive ones — don't apply.

---

## What About the Clinics Who Use PPN Portal?

Some clinics that use PPN Portal are HIPAA-covered entities themselves —
meaning HIPAA applies to *them* and the records *they* keep.

That's fine. A clinic using PPN Portal is similar to a hospital using
a spreadsheet: the hospital is subject to HIPAA, but the spreadsheet
software company isn't.

PPN Portal's role is similar to that spreadsheet company. It provides
a tool. The clinic controls what goes into it. Because the tool is
architecturally incapable of receiving PHI, PPN Portal never becomes
what HIPAA calls a "Business Associate" — the category of vendor that
must sign compliance agreements and carry the associated costs.

---

## What This Costs Competitors

For context: building a platform that *does* store PHI (like a traditional
Electronic Health Record) requires:

- **HIPAA compliance program:** $200K–$500K+ annually
- **Business Associate Agreements** with every vendor
- **Breach notification obligations** if data is stolen or leaked
- **Subpoena vulnerability:** a court order can force disclosure of
  patient records — names, addresses, diagnoses, all of it

PPN Portal's compliance cost for PHI: **$0.**

Not due to cutting corners — due to building it right from the start.

## What We Are Seeking from Legal Counsel

To formally certify this position, we have engaged healthcare regulatory
counsel to review our architecture and render a written opinion confirming:

1. PPN Portal is not a HIPAA Covered Entity
2. PPN Portal is not a HIPAA Business Associate (even when serving Covered Entities)
3. The records stored in our database do not constitute Protected Health Information
4. Our pseudonymization approach meets the HIPAA de-identification standard

A full technical memorandum describing our architecture — at the functional level,
without disclosing proprietary implementation details — has been prepared and
submitted to counsel for this purpose.

Upon receipt of counsel's written opinion, PPN Portal will be in a position to
represent to partners, insurers, and institutional buyers that its platform
has been reviewed and certified as operating outside the scope of HIPAA.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"So you're not HIPAA compliant?"**

This is like asking whether a filing cabinet manufacturer is "HIPAA compliant."
HIPAA applies to healthcare providers and their business associates who handle
patient health information. Because PPN Portal is architected to never receive
identifiable patient information, the compliance requirement simply doesn't attach.
We don't need to be HIPAA compliant in the same way a hammer doesn't need to be
a screwdriver.

**"What if a practitioner accidentally types patient information into the system?"**

The platform's input forms do not contain fields for patient names, dates of birth,
or any other identifying information. There is nowhere to type it. This is
intentional — it's not a policy restriction, it's a design constraint.

**"What happens if PPN Portal's database is hacked?"**

The attacker gets a database full of indecipherable codes, numbers, and reference
table integers. There are no names. No addresses. No information that would let
anyone identify which patients received which treatments. The data is, in effect,
scientifically valuable but legally useless for identification purposes.

**"Could this change if regulations change?"**

HIPAA has been law since 1996 and the definition of PHI has remained stable.
The core principle — that de-identified information is not PHI — is foundational
to how the healthcare research and technology industries function. A change to
this definition would affect every anonymized research database in academic medicine.
We will continue to monitor regulatory developments and update our compliance
position accordingly.

**"Does this mean practitioners can use PPN Portal to document illegal activity
without legal risk?"**

No. PPN Portal's architecture protects patients from re-identification. It does
not and cannot protect practitioners from their own legal exposure if they are
engaged in unlawful activity. PPN Portal takes no position on the legal status
of any specific practitioner's activities in their jurisdiction.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does HIPAA apply to PPN Portal? | No — by architectural design |
| Does PPN Portal store patient names? | No — no fields exist for them |
| Can PPN Portal records identify a patient? | No — cryptographic pseudonymization prevents this |
| Does PPN Portal sign Business Associate Agreements? | Not required — no PHI handled |
| Is legal counsel certifying this? | Yes — formal opinion letter in progress |
| What does this cost in compliance overhead? | $0 (vs. $200K–$500K+ for PHI-based platforms) |
