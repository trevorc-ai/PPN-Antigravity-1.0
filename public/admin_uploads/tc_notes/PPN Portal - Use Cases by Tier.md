🚀 Strategic Positioning by Tier  
Grey Market → Legal Market Transition  
The "Shadow to Sunlight" Strategy:

Phase 1 (Now): Capture grey market with safety tools

Deploy "Tradecraft Tools" (Blind Vetting, Crisis Logger, Potency Calculator)  
Capture 10,000+ sessions of real-world data  
Build trust with underground community  
Phase 2 (12-18 months): Grey market practitioners transition to legal

Oregon/Colorado licensing programs launch  
Underground practitioners use "Legacy Transcript" to prove experience  
Upgrade to paid tiers as they go legal  
Phase 3 (24+ months): Use aggregated data to support FDA applications

Sell "Real-World Evidence" (RWE) to pharma  
Support new drug applications with safety data  
Become industry standard for psychedelic therapy data  
Value:

Grey market users become paying customers when legal  
Real-world evidence (RWE) from grey market \= competitive moat  
"Career insurance" feature creates lock-in  
Consumer → Practitioner Upsell  
The "Self-Guided to Guided" Funnel:

Consumer uses free tier for self-tracking

Platform connects them to practitioners  
Practitioner pays subscription, consumer stays free  
Value:

Two-sided marketplace dynamics  
Network effects (more consumers \= more practitioners)  
Practitioner acquisition cost \= $0 (organic)  
Practitioner → Clinic → Network Expansion  
The "Solo to Scale" Path:

Solo practitioner starts at $49/month  
Hires second practitioner → upgrades to clinic tier ($299/month)  
Opens second location → upgrades to network tier ($2,499/month)  
Grows to 10+ locations → enterprise contract ($10,000+/month)  
Value:

Natural expansion revenue (land and expand)  
Sticky (data lock-in)
