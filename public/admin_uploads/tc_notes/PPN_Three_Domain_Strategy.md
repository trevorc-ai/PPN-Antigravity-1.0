# PPN Portal — The Three Domain Strategy
### A plain-language overview for collaborators and partners

*Last updated: February 23, 2026*

## The Simple Version

PPN Portal owns three web addresses that each serve a different audience.
Think of it like a hospital campus:

- The **clinic** is where patients go for treatment
- The **staff lounge** is where doctors talk to each other privately
- The **research center** is where the data goes to help the wider world

All three buildings are on the same campus, under the same name.
None of them do the other's job.

## The Three Addresses

### 🔵 ppnportal.net — The Clinical Tool
**"Where practitioners do the work"**

This is the software application — the tool a practitioner logs into
before, during, and after a session. It handles:

- Pre-session safety checks and consent
- Real-time session monitoring and vital sign logging
- Post-session outcome scoring (PHQ-9, GAD-7, MEQ-30)
- Benchmarking: "How does my protocol compare to the network?"

**Who uses it:** Licensed practitioners, clinic operators, facilitators

**What it does NOT store:** Any patient names, dates of birth, addresses,
or any other identifying information. The database is architecturally
designed to make this impossible — not just against policy, but
technically impossible.

**Why .net?** The `.net` extension has always signified "the infrastructure"
— the technical backbone. Practitioners and clinicians will recognize
this instinctively.

### 🟢 ppnportal.com — The Practitioner Network
**"Where practitioners talk to each other"**

This is a completely separate platform where practitioners can:

- Build an **opt-in public profile** listing their credentials,
  modalities, and areas of experience
- Join **supervision circles** — small, curated groups of 4 to 8
  peers who meet regularly for professional support and case review
- Request **case consultation** — if a practitioner encounters
  a medication combination or clinical situation they haven't seen
  before, they can quickly find colleagues who have

**The connection to the clinical tool:**
When the clinical tool flags a safety warning during a session
(for example: "Caution — patient is on lithium, which interacts
with psilocybin"), a link appears reading:

> *"4 practitioners in the PPN network have documented experience
> managing this contraindication. View their profiles →"*

That link opens ppnportal.com. The practitioner can then reach
out to a colleague who has been there before — even at 11pm
on a Tuesday night when no one else is awake.

**Who uses it:** Any practitioner who opts in. Participation is
voluntary. Nothing from the clinical tool is shared here.

**Why this is legally safe:** Because ppnportal.com is a completely
separate application that never touches the clinical database,
there is no HIPAA entanglement. The only thing that crosses between
the two is a simple number: how many opt-in practitioners have
logged a similar case. No names. No patient data. Just a count.

**Why .com?** The `.com` extension is what people type first when
they're looking for a community or a product. It's the front door
that the public world — press, partners, researchers — defaults to
linking toward.

### 🟠 ppnportal.org — The Research Layer
**"Where the data helps the wider world"**

As the network grows, a body of anonymized aggregate data builds up.
This layer is where that data becomes publicly useful:

- **Annual outcomes reports:** "In 2026, the PPN network documented
  4,200 sessions. Here is what the aggregate data shows about efficacy,
  safety, and protocol variation."
- **The open vocabulary standard:** The clinical terminology PPN uses
  (substances, routes of administration, outcomes scales, adverse event
  codes) is published openly so researchers and regulators can build
  on it
- **Policy submissions:** When a state legislature or federal agency
  is considering psychedelic policy, PPN.org is where the real-world
  evidence lives that can inform those decisions
- **Academic citations:** When researchers publish papers, they cite
  .org sources. This is where PPN earns credibility with universities,
  regulatory bodies, and insurance companies

**Who uses it:** Researchers, journalists, policymakers, insurance
payers, and anyone in the general public wanting to understand the
field

**Why .org?** The `.org` extension signals public trust — non-commercial,
mission-driven, intended for the common good. Insurance companies and
regulators instinctively trust .org sources more than .com sources.
This is not an accident.

## How the Three Layers Work Together

```
A practitioner logs a session
on ppnportal.net
          │
          │  Safety warning fires
          │  during session
          │
          ▼
"4 practitioners have experience
with this — view profiles"
          │
          │  Link opens
          ▼
ppnportal.com
Practitioner network
Practitioner finds a colleague,
gets support, problem solved
          │
          │  Over time, thousands of
          │  sessions accumulate
          ▼
ppnportal.org
Anonymized aggregate data
published for research,
policy, and insurance
```

Each layer feeds the next.
The tool builds the network.
The network builds the data.
The data changes the policy.

## Why One Brand Across All Three

The alternative would be to create separate brands for each layer —
a different name, logo, and website for each. This is how most
companies approach it. The problem is:

- It confuses practitioners who encounter the brand in different contexts
- It divides marketing investment across three separate identities
- It makes it harder for press and partners to understand the big picture

By keeping all three under the PPN Portal name, every piece of press
coverage, every conference badge, every word-of-mouth referral builds
the same brand equity. When someone hears "PPN Portal" in a supervision
circle, and then sees "ppnportal.org" cited in a journal article,
and then searches "ppnportal.com" — it all reinforces the same
singular identity.

**One name. Three rooms. One campus.**

## What This Looks Like to an Outsider

A journalist writing about psychedelic therapy:
> *"The PPN Portal (ppnportal.com) is building what it calls an
> operating system for psychedelic practice..."*
→ They link to .com. That's the front door. It points inward.

An insurance company evaluating reimbursement:
> *"According to PPN Portal's 2026 outcomes report (ppnportal.org)..."*
→ They cite .org. That's the credibility anchor. It builds trust.

A practitioner telling a colleague:
> *"You should check out ppnportal.net — it's what I use for
> session documentation."*
→ They share .net. That's the tool. It drives adoption.

All three paths lead to the same place.

## Timeline

| Phase | Domain | When |
|---|---|---|
| Now | ppnportal.net — clinical tool | Live today |
| Q2 2026 | ppnportal.com — practitioner network | After advisory board formation |
| Q3 2026 | ppnportal.org — research/public layer | After first 1,000 sessions logged |

The practitioner network does not need to be fully built before it
appears in the product. A simple "Coming Soon" page on ppnportal.com
is sufficient for the initial Dr. Allen demo — what matters is that
the concept is visible and the link works.
