### **Summary**

Jason Bluth (NMLS \# 1724308\) shared external research notes with PPN Admin on competitive databases and intake forms from experts like Dr. Lori Mishel, while also providing updates on growing the clinical network with professionals such as Dr. Russell Hill and Julian Bareilles, who all seek standardization and guidance on drug conflicts. PPN Admin presented the updated application (v3.1) featuring institutional standard data architecture, a connected AI neural engine for protocol searches, a drug interaction and safety matrix, and a "zero knowledge architecture" for HIPAA compliance, emphasizing the system's role as a community-driven efficacy database. Jason Bluth (NMLS \# 1724308\) also discussed a consulting opportunity for the Utah-based Singularism.com group, the value proposition of their network, and plans to schedule a deep-dive feedback session with Dr. Allen to refine the platform.

### **Details**

* **Competitive and Reference Databases** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) shared information about a database called Althea, which is attempting to capture some aspects of what their group is doing, but is viewed negatively by practitioners who find the Colorado simple form through Altha to be non-user-friendly ([00:03:12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.1kyeogogm19d)). Jason also highlighted other external resources, including the Citizens Science at microdoingcsychedelics.com site for self-reported microdosing experiences, and the Ibeane patient survey.org for self-reported Ibeane data ([00:04:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.hlps8sb9eshl)).

* **Intake Forms and Data Collection Tools** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) mentioned Dr. Allen, a team member, favored an initial client engagement questionnaire intake form, and Jason had copied the link. Jason also noted a self-guided microdosing book by James Fatiman that includes self-reporting, underscoring the scattered nature of self-reported data that their project aims to centralize. A service called redcap.com was identified as an online database tool for gathering survey information ([00:05:57](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.yzo1hbcx858u)).

* **Noted Intake Form from Expert** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) informed PPN Admin about Dr. Lori Mishel, Dr. Allen's ex-wife and a "premier scientist addressing Parkinsons in the world," and that Dr. Allen liked her intake form, which Jason captured for reference. Jason stressed that this information was being collected for awareness and did not require immediate changes, as it was captured in their meeting notes ([00:06:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.97fwt2e0l9t1)).

* **Building the Clinical Network** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) provided an update on meeting with physicians to grow the network, including Dr. Russell Hill, an ER doctor in Hawaii who is purchasing a ketamine clinic ([00:07:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.eirpcf9oooj)). Jason is connecting these professionals with Dr. Allen and their network to provide clinical advice and guidance on treatments, as many feel lost despite attending conferences ([00:08:34](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.bnri65kiyoiv)). Jason is actively pitching their demo and hub-and-spoke concept to create value ([00:09:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.apebw3w46d28)).

* **Practitioner Needs and Standardization** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) also met with Julian Bareilles, a marriage and family therapist licensed in four states, who echoed the need to standardize forms. Julian emphasized the necessity for guidance on medication conflicts and setting up procedures, directly aligning with the project's goals ([00:09:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.apebw3w46d28)).

* **Engagement with Utah-based Clinics (Singularism.com)** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) detailed a highly productive meeting with the Utah-based people associated with Singularism.com, who are involved in a lawsuit with the state and have received some state approval ([00:10:10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.e96lijrcrsac)). Jason explained that these folks, who focus on psilocybin, need business solutions, particularly help with business strategy and scalability ([00:10:57](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.5icvvacs2mn6)).

* **Strategy and Scalability Consulting Opportunity** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) positioned PPN Admin as the expert consultant for the Utah group's need for strategy and scalability ([00:10:57](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.5icvvacs2mn6)). Jason is planning to go in first to understand their business model and glitches, and then arrange a meeting for Admin to conduct a deep dive with these key connections, described as the "darlings of the legalization clan" ([00:11:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.rp4rxarx48jz)) ([00:14:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.6kzwfxihdlth)). Jason expects to schedule a meeting with Admin and the Utah group soon, noting the group is well-off and offers a unique opportunity ([00:12:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.275mkir32ny3)) ([00:14:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.6kzwfxihdlth)).

* **The Network’s Legitimacy and Value Proposition** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) emphasized the unique validity of their growing network, which includes an NIH-funded doctor, a professor (PPN Admin), and experienced businesspeople. This network addresses the clinics' urgent need for knowledge on drug conflicts and safety, which is crucial as many practitioners are currently "shooting themselves in the foot" by not having this information ([00:15:11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.zoynhrj1rer)).

* **Dr. Allen's Role and Legitimacy** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) clarified to PPN Admin that Dr. Jason Allen is an NIH-funded doctor and naturopath, serving as the network's guru and a resource for clinicians seeking guidance. Dr. Allen is a strong advocate for their product, providing legitimacy and promoting the network, and he specifically appreciated the application's affinity binding feature for substance analysis ([00:19:40](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.p9p1dpcuw8p)) ([00:21:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.nqjo3fuxmugj)).

* **Institutional Data Standardization** PPN Admin explained that they designed the application with "institutional standard" data architecture, with "big pharma potential," by researching NIH and FDA data standards for codes and form fields ([00:22:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.1xo33j8aq6oo)). This preparation ensures the data will be standardized from the beginning, allowing for easy absorption by external entities and monetization ([00:24:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.coziyunqnsh)).

* **HIPAA Compliance and Liability Protection** PPN Admin confirmed that they researched HIPAA and PHI liabilities to ensure the system is built to avoid regulatory issues by keeping all patient information anonymized ([00:24:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.coziyunqnsh)) ([00:35:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.39a5grp77ywu)). The Protocol Builder automatically creates a random, unique identifier for patients, which allows practitioners to track and share treatment protocols and outcomes without sharing personal health information or requiring substantial legal fees for full HIPAA compliance ([00:32:59](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.fslcc3h4ceb5)) ([00:40:03](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.41jyekeu3wxx)).

* **Application Updates and AI Integration** PPN Admin shared an updated version of the application (v3.1) in a sandbox environment, which now includes a connected AI neural engine ([00:28:51](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.ac1oofkpa6z2)) ([00:30:30](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.geqq5uh1yxaf)). This engine will allow users to search protocols based on criteria like demographics and conditions, utilizing aggregated data ([00:28:51](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.ac1oofkpa6z2)) ([00:31:09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.dnferjma27jz)). The application also features a live dashboard with key metrics such as active protocols, adverse events, and average efficacy ([00:31:09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.dnferjma27jz)) ([00:47:04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.lmosfe5mzay4)).

* **Drug Interaction and Safety Feature** PPN Admin highlighted a new and highly valuable feature that aggregates information on drug interactions and safety from both proprietary data and external public sources ([00:41:02](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.lhbxb1bg3hqm)). This matrix helps practitioners quickly identify potential conflicts, such as reduced efficacy or severe adverse events, addressing a crucial need expressed by clinics who lack toxicity and safety protocols ([00:42:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.iy65gffsxz4r)).

* **Database Philosophy: Collective Intelligence and Benchmarking** PPN Admin emphasized that the application is a "community-driven efficacy database" and not a clinical record storage system ([00:53:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.h86lj9y5pb5v)). The goal is to provide a "global hive mind of psychedelic medicine," allowing practitioners to contribute anonymous data and benchmark their practice against the collective intelligence, thereby improving their dosing, frequency, and overall therapy effectiveness ([00:54:35](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.vii0g9ysafe1)) ([00:56:39](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.f55n4fobe5j8)).

* **Data Submission and System Expansion** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) confirmed that pushing for expanded clinical protocols remains valuable, but the system's design now allows users to proceed based on available information by entering criteria, regardless of full protocol uploads ([00:59:36](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.7ye0heaizhls)). PPN Admin and Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) discussed how the system expanded beyond just uploaded protocols, enabling general users to enter data for customized insights, which Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) described as brilliant ([01:00:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.43lv5ts9detc)). The system will also cross-reference the internal database of community-collected data with publicly available information via an AI search feature ([01:02:36](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.ym86cqqejmu5)).

* **System Benefits and Practitioner Value** PPN Admin outlined key benefits of the platform for practitioners, including an evidence-based roadmap for complex patients, demonstrated by finding successful cases that suggest switching to a lower dose with higher frequency ([01:06:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.gmwkz4gaanqe)). They emphasized the value of the platform as a source of live, real-time data from the community, contrasting it with potentially outdated research publications ([01:07:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.wougf9eb7n5p)). The system is designed to provide real-time fine-tuning of protocols based on current field data, keeping clinics at the "forefront of efficacy" by adapting protocols faster than traditional research cycles ([01:13:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.h95gplvt4pt0)).

* **Early Warning and Safety Features** PPN Admin detailed the early warning system functionality, where logging an adverse event can trigger a warning about similar reactions reported by other clinics, potentially identifying issues like a bad batch of medication or new interaction risks months before official warnings ([01:08:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.knxndq1cpqy)). Additionally, the system functions as a "safety partner" with a drug interaction checker that can flag risks, such as a high dose of a substance for patients on SSRIs, to prevent experimentation ([01:15:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.5jsvovfqxh2)).

* **Practitioner Engagement and Feedback** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) mentioned conducting high-level, 30-minute demos and expressed the need to schedule deep-dive sessions with practitioners like Dr. Allen once the new version of the platform is ready for feedback and shaping ([01:10:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.9gcc6kfw7wn2)). They suggested scheduling a multi-hour session with Dr. Allen to walk through details, as their input, coming from 20 years in the industry, would be crucial for refining the platform ([01:11:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.bp8ept58muf0)) ([01:18:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.8ugekgey8q1y)). PPN Admin agreed that getting feedback from practitioners like Dr. Allen is essential, particularly to understand what data they are collecting and what outputs they value, as the value is in the aggregated data, not the storage ([01:12:24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.7b1evlxokziv)).

* **HIPAA Compliance and Data Privacy** PPN Admin addressed practitioners' concerns about data breaches and HIPAA compliance by explaining the "zero knowledge architecture," which uses a local-first privacy model where patient names and personally identifiable information are not collected ([01:15:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.5jsvovfqxh2)). They confirmed that the system assigns its own patient identifiers that only the practitioner can link back to their patients, ensuring they cannot violate HIPAA through the platform ([01:16:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.8dchz11khq3)). PPN Admin noted the importance of showcasing the anonymized data functionality, especially for adding data, because privacy and liability are critical aspects ([01:19:36](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.yzvmbarw1fu5)).

* **Demo Planning and Readiness** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) planned to use the current, familiar demo version for an upcoming presentation to Julian, but PPN Admin recommended using the updated version to demonstrate the streamlined approach and the crucial anonymization features ([01:19:36](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.yzvmbarw1fu5)). Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) committed to setting up the deep-dive meeting with Dr. Allen in Seattle, with PPN Admin confirming they have an unlimited Zoom account from the academy to host the meeting and record it for transcription purposes ([01:19:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.9mz5lizhqtu7)) ([01:21:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.x63jp3db4b5c)). PPN Admin shared updated demo instructions and scripting to help Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) walk through the features in a way that resonates with the practitioners' perspective ([01:17:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.2cw2t3zgndj6)) ([01:21:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.se1e608gl4rh)).

* **Dr. Allen's Database Input** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) recounted that Dr. Allen mentioned four databases the system should pull from, but clarified that this was likely a conceptual observation about drawing from multiple sources rather than knowledge of specific databases. Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) advised PPN Admin that gathering specific database information is not crucial before the deep dive, as Dr. Allen's detailed input will likely emerge once they interact with the formalized platform ([01:11:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.5or8xqilzrt9)) ([01:25:29](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.bcedc35pwfpa)). PPN Admin committed to making the updated, HIPAA-compliant demo version ready with more populated data for Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) by that night or the next day ([01:26:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.s8qz6f5vfdeg)) ([01:27:35](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.ywrjqsh7gqzs)).

* **Development Follow-up Items** Following the discussion, PPN Admin detailed a list of internal development tasks, including fixing quick links on the research portal and connecting subsequent treatments to patient records ([01:29:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.nlq64fxq641u)). Other technical tasks include building out the practitioners page, examining and refining the substance cards, expanding the interaction checker, and ensuring that the system can answer what drives the data for efficacy validation trends. They also noted the need to refine the audit logs, activate open protocol links, and decide on the contents of the settings and help pages ([01:29:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwwhAa2yrfxMEecpKJO--eThMajDO6WNYn7WuDYG1_c/edit?tab=t.df66f990n0o6#heading=h.nlq64fxq641u)).

### **Summary**

PPN Admin and Jason Bluth (NMLS \# 1724308\) discussed the project's value proposition, which centers on outputs, analytics, and data comparison to the aggregate, with PPN Admin emphasizing the use of FHIR standards, standardized inputs, and AI tools to manage uncategorized data and ensure data integration. Jason Bluth (NMLS \# 1724308\) updated PPN Admin on meeting four distinct clinician profiles and the importance of drug interaction data, noting the project's need to capitalize on value propositions like synthesis of efficacy improvements, and they also explored potential features like QEEG brain scanning integration and wearable data. The discussion also covered the system's design for ease of use, data anonymization, two input methods (individual and bulk upload), a robust search portal with AI integration, and a monetization strategy involving integrating platform access into a client's practitioner training program.

### **Details**

* **Personal Update and Project Excitement** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) shared that they were calling in from their father's unchanged childhood bedroom, noting that the location is like a time capsule from the 60s ([00:00:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.kzk27hm1jsla)). PPN Admin expressed excitement about the project's evolving vision, noting that the current progress is mostly standardized inputs and that the true value for practitioners will be in the outputs, analytics, and comparing data to the aggregate ([00:01:18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.k2355m69wk9n)).

* **Mormonism and Mission** PPN Admin mentioned discovering recently that Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) grew up Mormon, leading Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) to confirm they completed a mission in Arizona, where they self-taught Spanish ([00:00:37](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.dtxmklu17zei)). Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) humorously remarked that coming back to their hometown to deal with the newly legalized substances is a "blast" because they know how oppressed the Mormon community is ([00:01:18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.k2355m69wk9n)).

* **Practitioner Profiles and Needs** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) provided an update from a meeting with Julian, who agreed to help with standardization, and discussed four different clinician profiles: the highly knowledgeable scientist/small clinician owner (like Dr. Allen), the family therapist/marriage counselor licensed in multiple states (Julian), people training others on treatments who are not clinicians, and ER doctors seeking preventive upstream solutions ([00:02:21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.t4clnxu0i31f)). Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) emphasized that drug interaction data is immensely important to the third profile, and the fourth profile (ER doctor) has no experience but is buying a clinic ([00:03:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.35xu66bmfkzd)).

* **Existing EMR Systems and Value Proposition** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) discussed systems like 'Rula' and 'Simple Practice,' which are Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems used by practitioners, and noted a need to review what's currently available to determine how the project fits in and avoids overlap. They highlighted that the EMRs offer comprehensive services like online search, insurance checks, scheduling, and payment systems, which inform the needed "lay of the land" review ([00:03:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.b24znh25zkpt)). Julian was particularly enthusiastic about the access to real-time data and the synthesis of efficacy improvements, such as five points better on the PHQ score, which is a value proposition that Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) believes the project needs to fully capitalize on ([00:05:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.tr0nsw8v8lo)).

* **Next Steps and Deep Dives** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) confirmed that the next step would be "deep dives" with PPN Admin to review use cases and define the important outputs ([00:05:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.tr0nsw8v8lo)). They also noted that Julian liked the concept of harm reduction ([00:06:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.ctom4kdy7yb9)).

* **Brain Scanning Technology Integration** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) shared a compelling potential feature inspired by Julian, involving the integration of a portable brain scan machine called a QEEG. They explained that this system could connect brain scan data to the project's platform, allowing users to see how brains react to treatments based on underlying conditions and parameters, which is seen as cool and helpful for the network ([00:07:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.cqfvvevbcidj)).

* **Wearable Data and Peripheral Devices** PPN Admin confirmed the forward-thinking approach by stating they had "literally just added wearables and wearable data to the plan," which Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) appreciated as a necessary inclusion for peripherals ([00:07:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.cqfvvevbcidj)). The broader scope of the system extends beyond contributing clinicians to include general users needing access to real-time or broader data to guide their protocols ([00:09:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.x0njblspxhnb)).

* **Data Standardization and Interoperability** PPN Admin explained that they researched industry database schemas and are basing the system on the modern technical standard for data transfer called FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) ([00:09:06](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.x0njblspxhnb)). The design prioritizes data integration from the start, which means inputs are strictly standardized, often via drop-down boxes, to prevent variability ([00:10:04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.rlvs4i1bni4)). The system uses standard codes like RXNorm for substances (e.g., Psilocybin code 1433), UCUM for units of measurement, and MedDRA for adverse events ([00:11:12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.8apnfcaqd67m)).

* **Project Management and System Organization** PPN Admin humorously recognized their own need for improved organizational skills and mentioned that their partner, Molly, is considering grad school, suggesting they might pursue a master's in project management as well ([00:12:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.kou8sndj90pq)). They emphasized the recent realization of the importance of an organized, repeatable system for project execution ([00:13:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.8vo713x5ems)).

* **Handling Uncategorized Data and AI Tools** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) asked how the system would handle non-categorical inputs such as detailed clinical notes or subjective descriptions ("smelled like sulfur in the air") ([00:14:23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.3v2ixapthid7)). PPN Admin stated that they have already anticipated this need and are using AI tools and various AI systems communicating with each other to manage the complexity and standardize inputs ([00:12:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.kou8sndj90pq)) ([00:15:12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.38pg8qoarvm1)). They acknowledged that while most inputs will be standardized drop-downs, there will be a mechanism for users to request new features or categories if what they are looking for is missing ([00:17:34](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.cxv3u7hzhkyx)).

* **Political Involvement and Strategy** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) informed PPN Admin about Brian running for the House representative seat, District 29, and anticipated PPN Admin's involvement in strategy and consulting for the campaign ([00:15:12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.38pg8qoarvm1)). Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) is seeking experienced people in the political space and is working on obtaining funding, positioning this effort as a potential "very busy lane" with cash flow for PPN Admin, who expressed appreciation for the opportunity to build a track record in AI-integrated cutting-edge systems ([00:16:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.6spsuz60pts6)).

* **Audience Definition and Data Input Requirements** PPN Admin stressed the need to clearly define the ideal customer profile to master the "meaty part of the curve". They outlined that while the system will be easy to use, practitioners must provide data in a system-readable format and cannot simply submit handwritten notes for transcription ([00:18:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.1yweqeobg55d)). They confirmed that data storage and notes will remain with the practitioners until they voluntarily share them, citing wearables as an example where data sharing is easier due to existing HIPAA compliance ([00:19:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.l1p2fa7ihs55)).

* **Data Input Methods: Individual and Bulk** PPN Admin confirmed two data input methods: individual and bulk uploads ([00:20:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.rgizb6mbssp6)). Bulk data upload is planned for clinics with existing years of stored data, while individual input will be used for ongoing treatment records, which staff can enter quickly. PPN Admin acknowledged that practitioners with bulk data will likely need to do some organization, but the system will offer AI tools and resources to simplify the work ([00:21:02](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.3ktkwxgcwng6)).

* **Demonstration and Site Tour** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) emphasized that system success depends on ease of use to overcome barriers of convenience and cost, and asked PPN Admin for a full site tour ([00:22:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.1brmy3hywc60)). PPN Admin confirmed the availability of demo notes, instructions, an FAQ, and a step-by-step checklist script for demos ([00:23:39](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.fduhr5owh6rj)).

* **Search Portal and Data Presentation** PPN Admin showcased the robust search portal, which, when a user types in a substance like "ketamine," instantly shows matching substances and allows clinicians to see a quick overview or dig into a patient's treatment ([00:26:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.iudmytjav1q4)). The system tracks progress using scores like the PHQ9, showing points of efficacy improvement, and even includes details on patient environment factors like curated music playlists, which Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) praised as brilliant and critical ([00:28:11](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.gdko46r4saml)).

* **Filtering and AI Integration in Search** The search portal includes extensive filters for treatment setting (clinic, home, retreat center), substance, and outcome (protocols that worked, or "really worked"). The system also integrates AI at the top of the search results to provide a total snapshot of relevant clinicians and substances based on a filter combination (e.g., MDMA and SSRIs) ([00:29:53](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.r5osg0oatz14)).

* **System Design Principles** PPN Admin stated that the system is designed to be intuitive and require only one or two clicks, avoiding cognitive overload and tediousness for clinicians, which was informed by extensive research into what practitioners seek in therapy systems ([00:31:59](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.a7kukwy21tqr)). They mentioned the inclusion of scientifically correct, color 3D molecular structures, which will be visible once the system is hosted ([00:32:50](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.8zvh775cap2d)).

* **Interaction Checker and Data Sourcing** PPN Admin demonstrated the interaction checker, which allows practitioners to select a substance (like psilocybin) and a medication (like lithium) and instantly displays potential contraindications, with the source of the information directly provided for verification ([00:34:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.2oqeoz3nzvg)) ([00:36:59](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.w4z9zueqviut)). The system is designed to pull data from live or regularly updated external sources, minimizing manual updating ([00:37:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.128i4zcqcpb6)).

* **Audit Log and Protocol Upload** PPN Admin showed the audit log, which records every touchpoint on the database ([00:38:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.e0beulh8bkqk)). They then demonstrated the protocol upload screen, highlighting that all treatments are anonymized with a new, simplified process for practitioners. The system is designed to protect practitioners from liability and mistakes, with value baked into the aggregate data and individual clinician safety ([00:39:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.twe0mr7elmss)).

* **Patient Identification and Anonymization** The system hashes patient data locally and the portal never sees the patient's name; patients are assigned an 8-digit alpha-numeric encrypted key ([00:41:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.uq3swytzcpmr)). Practitioners can easily look up patients by their birth month and year (not specific birth date) along with age and gender, which acts as a unique identifier for selecting a patient's record, similar to how pharmacies verify prescriptions ([00:42:04](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.z81wgc4z99ac)).

* **New Treatment Protocol Input** PPN Admin outlined the four sections for new treatment input: demographics, clinical setting (e.g., clinic, med spa, retreat center, telehealth), time spent on preparation and integration, and modalities (e.g., CBT, somatic, playlists) ([00:44:18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.rqwl5ca8mln2)). The system uses standard medical terms for substance administration and tracks concurrent medications, enabling cross-referencing for potential adverse effects ([00:46:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.3jky5i6kdp3s)).

* **Contraindication and Safety Alert System** The system records concurrent medications so that if a practitioner is reviewing a successful or unsuccessful treatment record, the system can alert them if their patient is on a contraindicating medication like lithium ([00:47:47](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.frin0sbh8j5j)). Adverse effects are categorized from mild to life-threatening, and the system records the resolution status (resolved in session, post session, or unresolved) ([00:50:03](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.v7dp4r7d0tdf)).

* **Patient Journey Tracking and Therapeutic Envelope** The system allows for tracking multiple treatments for the same patient, with the new version displaying all data points in a graph to show the pattern and whole journey ([00:52:12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.pnbgn96hobgn)). The "therapeutic envelope" captures the context of the therapy, including the setting, support ratio (practitioner-to-patient), time spent, and music used, all of which was informed by AI-driven analysis of common threads and language used by practitioners in public forums and discussions ([00:53:18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.wx2gl7rl4bb0)).

* **Future of Tracking Metrics** Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) inquired if the system needs to include other trackers besides the PHQ9 score, such as standardized metrics for PTSD or anxiety ([00:56:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.rw3h05m8mx14)). PPN Admin recognized this as a great question and expressed enthusiasm for involving Dr. Allen to examine the current protocols and determine which specific metrics should be adopted by the community ([00:57:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.y865er3hwo8b)).

* **Product Development and Deep Dive** PPN Admin indicated their need for established standards to guide development and filter out unnecessary information. Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308\) agreed and planned to schedule a deep dive session next week, potentially lasting a couple of hours, to work through the details and establish the structure quickly ([00:58:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.8rd6z430wz8h)). Mr. Calton also noted that the updated product version combines a landing page with a powerful search engine/filter page ([00:58:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.vffqbltogp7e)).

* **Elevating Practitioner Knowledge** Mr. Bluth expressed enthusiasm about presenting the updated product, especially to casual practitioners, stating that the new functionality elevates their knowledge by providing access to data that is not readily available. They also described the value of the platform in capturing valuable data from scientists and feeding it back to practitioners, creating a tiered value structure that benefits everyone ([00:59:49](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.e2hv35845y11)). Mr. Calton affirmed that they are aligned on the development and will ensure Mr. Bluth has written answers for anticipated questions ([01:02:12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.vqi8nnwii7a2)).

* **Frequently Asked Questions and Compliance** Mr. Calton outlined key points for the FAQ, including the reason for not entering notes (zero PHI policy) and how users can request specific features. They also discussed how the interaction checker is validated using sources like PubMed and institutional trials, and confirmed the system will be HIPAA compliant by only showing de-identified and aggregated data ([01:02:12](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.vqi8nnwii7a2)). Mr. Bluth considered the evolution of the product to be "really sexy" ([01:03:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.4w0xhg2x21wr)).

* **Accessing the Updated Version** Mr. Bluth requested the link for version 3.3 to familiarize themself with the platform, create dummy protocols, and prepare for their demo ([01:03:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.4w0xhg2x21wr)). Mr. Calton confirmed the 3.3 version was ready and shared the link in the chat, clarifying the access process, which included a prompt to continue to the app ([01:04:25](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.kwf4zmjt3gkp)) ([01:06:20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.fooudfd8gau3)). Mr. Calton confirmed this was the last stable version they had saved ([01:07:05](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.o5pflfvegc6h)).

* **Review of Product Features** Mr. Bluth navigated the new version, noting the filter button and the ability to reset options. They found the new features to be much more succinct ([01:07:40](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.mcdihpa9ftqu)). Mr. Bluth focused their review on the "my protocols" area, finding the therapeutic envelope view and the ability to see trend lines to be new and valuable, despite the current lack of extensive data ([01:09:37](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.ynfkoke576ew)).

* **Dashboard and Label Refinements** Mr. Calton clarified that the dashboard is still a work in progress and intended to be a high-level overview or a collection of snapshots, with the primary detail residing in other areas ([01:11:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.cm1o28d03lok)). They also invited Mr. Bluth's feedback on label clarity, suggesting an improvement to "support staff to patient ratio," and mentioned their goal to reduce all platform language to an "nth grade reading level" for simplicity ([01:12:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.y9d8aq400b1r)) ([01:14:29](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.8xqrx6l1hq1d)).

* **Business Strategy and Monetization** Mr. Bluth detailed their plan for Wednesday's meeting, aiming to understand the client's business needs and potentially conference Mr. Calton in as a business solution provider ([01:15:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.g09vavpss1u6)). Mr. Calton requested that Mr. Bluth gauge the perceived value of the platform without explicitly asking for pricing, as they need to establish a sustainable business model ([01:16:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.ddokidfftbtp)). Mr. Calton noted they plan to offer initial free trial access with guard rails for data quality but needs to determine a suitable subscription level ([01:16:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.jlgkhp7lwabt)).

* **Short-Term Monetization Plan** Mr. Bluth proposed integrating the platform into the client's business model, particularly their training program for 40 new practitioners this year, which focuses on the lowest barrier of entry to the practice ([01:19:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.2o2owdgm9t9p)). Mr. Bluth suggested that including access to the centralized data platform as part of the client's training package would immediately provide 40 new users and make the client a sole source for network access ([01:20:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.jnzkly3k7ekg)). Mr. Calton agreed with this approach, suggesting Mr. Bluth refer to them as a business partner who is open to taking on the earliest users for a fee to test the market value ([01:21:44](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg5jykKpWH6M0PAlR_aEuAtMmTZd8WxRbMWKC6Lo6pY/edit?tab=t.vd2nw163tydy#heading=h.dhf7ybumfe9e)).

### **Summary**

Jason detailed a business opportunity with Bridger, the head of the largest psychedelic church in the US, which will involve Jason supplying psilocybin and the church potentially becoming beta testers for their product. Jason proposed a road map for platform development, including user classifications, a plan for decentralized research by aggregating data for state governments, and a feature for tracking substance quality and licensing providers. Admin provided a live demonstration of the "PPN portal," an advanced, medically compliant SQL database built to pharma-ready standards, featuring a clinical intelligence dashboard, a molecular pharmacology section, and security through cryptographic random keys, while agreeing to deploy the application live for a demo with practitioner Sarah Honeyut the following day.

### **Details**

* **Psychedelic Church Business Opportunity** Jason discussed their business meeting with a representative from what they described as the largest psychedelic church in the US, run by a guy named Bridger, who started an AI mental health initiative ([00:01:57](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.mtmbww1r1ch0)). The church uses a loophole in California to sell psychedelics, specifically psilocybin tea, to church members ([00:02:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.ccx22n7cc46v)). Jason mentioned that they would be supplying the psilocybin to the church and provided "hippie flip packs" of various party drugs to Bridger and their partner, Brandy, for a party ([00:03:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.qz6o1gcsrjy0)).

* **Bridger's Church Model and Legal Status** Bridger's church business model is focused on having facilitators act as scribes during sessions where members consume psilocybin tea, helping them document their journey, which Bridger views as a source of inspiration regardless of belief. Jason noted that the church is in a legal battle with the government but is considered "legit" by judges, with a settlement or trial scheduled for the following year ([00:04:23](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.ktszq0o5siw3)) ([00:06:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.98tc5qqf00t1)).

* **Building a Relationship with Bridger** Jason successfully built rapport with Bridger, partially through shared interests like motorcycles, resulting in Jason offering coaching on track riding ([00:05:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.wpz558nkha3l)). Following a high-level demo of their product, Bridger's primary questions were about the readiness of the product and if their church could be beta testers, demonstrating strong interest ([00:05:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.pumkcknsfpuy)).

* **Positive Reception and Project Acceleration** Jason reported that Bridger and Brandy were extremely excited about the presentation, describing Bridger's enthusiasm as being like "a kid wanting cake" ([00:01:57](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.mtmbww1r1ch0)) ([00:08:32](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.yxtox3ff1mr)). Jason concluded that the new segment will lead to faster and larger monetization than initially anticipated, and they have developed a high-level roadmap ([00:06:46](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.98tc5qqf00t1)).

* **User Classifications and Phased Road Map** Jason outlined three potential user classifications for the platform: licensed facilitators, psychiatrists, and medical physicians ([00:09:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.aac2ojyj7obm)) ([00:12:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.35qc4hplmdbd)). They proposed a road map starting with "core functionality" for licensed facilitators, which involves basic patient tracking and data export for compliance, followed by "expanded functionality" for psychiatrists, and finally full capability for medical physicians driving research ([00:10:29](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.i6z9miyqjyqa)).

* **Decentralized Research and Revenue Stream** Jason proposed a long-term strategy for "peer-to-peer decentralized research" by aggregating data from all user levels, including licensed facilitators and medical professionals ([00:13:24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.ozf45bl96sl8)). This would enable them to offer states considering psychedelics legislation, such as Utah with its HP390 bill, a pre-existing, large data set, potentially creating a new revenue stream by selling scientific research data to state governments for a fraction of their budgeted costs ([00:12:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.35qc4hplmdbd)).

* **Substance Quality and Licensing Functionality** Jason emphasized the importance of tracking the quality and specific variety of psychedelic substances, such as different types of *cubensis*. This feature would enhance scientific research by correlating specific substance characteristics with treatment results and opens a new advertising and revenue stream through licensing approved substance providers ([00:15:43](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.n42lsmn373c)).

* **Development Progress and SQL Database** Admin interrupted Jason's presentation to inform them that they had already covered everything in their roadmap, stating they were trying to save time ([00:09:10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.r69vifjfsq0b)) ([00:14:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.e4tiyf89y9v)). Admin then revealed that they had been working non-stop and had created a live, fully secure, encrypted SQL database with 22 data tables, built to the security standards of a bank or pharmaceutical company ([00:17:21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.6p3nz36p665k)).

* **Pharmaceutical Readiness and Data Standards** Admin detailed that the database is "pharma ready," using standard industry codes like SNOMED and MedDRA, consistent with NIH and FDA requirements. This structure will be vital for credibility with doctors and the scientific community, ensuring the system is prepared for high-level regulatory scrutiny ([00:21:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.y8l25i8cxtzz)) ([00:43:02](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.jh5w3s81eyz0)).

* **Insurance Opportunity and Legal Coverage** Admin highlighted a potential down-the-road business opportunity to start an insurance company or group for practitioners who currently struggle to obtain business insurance, as the database is medically compliant and has no HIPAA risk. Jason added that Bridger is willing to extend the church's legal umbrella to cover the company and individual practitioners for liability concerning the federal legality of psychedelics ([00:22:53](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.35xgeyddvmmv)).

* **Upcoming Meetings and Equity Discussion** Jason planned to meet with Sarah Honeyut, a "frontline practitioner," and intends to use her positive reaction to engage John, who has expressed potential interest in helping with fundraising ([00:26:29](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.149hq2fhhs5g)). They acknowledged that the team, including Admin and Christian, needs to figure out company ownership and equity distribution for valuable contributors ([00:27:16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.68z8otbehg2m)).

* **Live Demo of the PPN Portal** Admin shared the screen to present the live version 1.0 of the application, called the PPN portal, available at ppnportal.net ([00:28:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.vhhuordvszkc)). The landing page features a ketamine molecule (later changed to psilocybin), promotes a "community-driven practitioner only outcomes registry," and highlights its function as a measurement and benchmarking tool ([00:30:38](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.5wooprjsu7mt)) ([00:35:39](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.7fi86pna8de7)).

* **Platform Features and Benchmarking** The PPN portal will allow practitioners to join, log, track, and benchmark their data, including using a severity matrix heat map based on practitioner-requested features ([00:31:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.hx1fbswjai6t)). The system is set up to allow comparisons at four levels: patient, clinic, network, and worldwide, facilitating "peer-to-peer decentralized research" ([00:33:40](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.svkqq5x3o5p6)). Admin confirmed the database is international and can compare individual treatments against tens of thousands of aggregate records ([00:34:41](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.gky2op3tg9e)).

* **Clinic Performance and Data Visualization** The portal includes a Clinic Performance dashboard that allows filtering by individual practitioners, single-site clinics, or networks of clinics, comparing efficacy, compliance, and even revenue if shared ([00:41:21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.vf1m5vyeopmx)). Data visualization tools include a spider graph for substance details and a Patient Galaxy map, where each dot represents a patient, allowing clinicians to see patterns in treatment resistance and symptom severity ([00:40:16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.id57neu80ga)) ([00:44:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.poh0tjnsocym)).

* **Data Security and Anonymity** Admin ensured the system is secure by using a 10-digit alphanumeric cryptographic random key for patient identification, meaning if the database were stolen, only numbers would be retrieved, preventing personal patient identification ([00:45:51](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.y8qwprp3zgen)) ([00:48:53](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.ma9osvl2dtg6)). Clinicians must securely store this unique identifier to track subsequent patient treatments ([00:47:08](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.oexwbmyhwwg)).

* **Molecular Pharmacology and Data Collection** The Molecular Pharmacology section features receptor binding charts with definitions, enabling comparison of substance effects on factors like empathy, mood, and visuals ([00:50:19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.3x7yghbmuubp)). Admin is setting up the interface to be highly scalable, allowing for the addition of new substances with a single script, and ensured all important actions are accessible in two clicks or less for user-friendliness ([00:53:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.jgw2oy6t7crw)).

* **Application as a Training Mechanism** Jason posed a use case for users who are new to the science and need guidance, emphasizing the need for comprehensive training documentation ([00:55:29](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.60e5yzif05yx)). Admin affirmed that the platform is designed to be converted into a training mechanism, where new trainees can learn and be tested on using the application, which can be sold as a service ([00:56:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.jbgxbcp7qzn5)).

* **Support for Independent Practitioners** Jason expressed excitement that many practitioners currently use paper records, making the developed tool highly valuable for enabling independent business operations, as existing legacy systems are often not user-friendly ([00:59:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.vxh99rxir3a0)). Admin clarified that the tool does not replace Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems but emphasized its efficiency for entering patient records in less than a minute ([00:59:57](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.cxhmwurzwcto)).

* **Standardization and Treatment Protocols** Jason Bluth suggested that the system should standardize the "biopsychosocial" history, potentially via a link sent to clients for pre-populating records, which would then allow clinicians to recommend treatment protocols based on state availability and gathered evidence ([01:00:54](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.wy795sum4bfl)). Admin agreed that the initial idea was to capture history and discussed an analysis comparing different treatment protocols for effectiveness, including practitioner cost analysis ([01:01:43](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.ecr1rmwvk7sl)).

* **Business Operations Intelligence Module** The discussion focused on the necessity of cost analysis, which Jason Bluth insisted should remain for feedback, particularly for clinic owners and business managers who might subscribe to a higher membership level ([01:03:52](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.peo5n2yrkiv6)) ([01:05:55](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.urk1a6ldqw73)). Admin confirmed this feature is part of the "intelligence modules" dedicated to "business operations," separate from patient protocols, and mentioned having 11 such modules, only five of which had been shown ([01:05:16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.xbpj8z19pzke)).

* **Clinical Intelligence Dashboard** Admin presented a clinical intelligence dashboard, a business operations snapshot that displays comparison metrics, patient alerts, and treatment counts, which can be filtered by time, location, or treatment type ([01:06:37](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.73g8fvthqkc2)). Jason Bluth emphasized the importance of covering this dashboard, especially in early meetings, since most initial contacts are with clinic owners ([01:07:44](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.2wdw1no2jytv)).

* **Real-Time Insights and Data Aggregation** Admin described the clinical intelligence dashboard as providing real-time insights into clinical outcomes and safety metrics, aggregating data across the network for informed treatment decisions ([01:08:33](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.ymmlrlwfur0e)). Jason Bluth praised the use case flexibility in the design and the logical placeholder structure of the dashboard for both individual practitioners and management levels ([01:09:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.t9lzh5ot8uv3)).

* **Publicly Accessible Safety Feature** Admin planned to offer a version of the molecular bridge, or an interaction checker component, for free on the landing page for public access as a safety measure ([01:10:14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.i3boyiz8rf9z)). Jason Bluth expanded on this concept, envisioning a free, non-profit app for Android and Apple that would pull data for safety protocols, recovery plans, and guidance, particularly for users attending events like raves ([01:11:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.yh34s852oclu)).

* **Mobile Responsiveness and App Deployment** Admin confirmed the application is designed to be mobile-responsive, allowing the safety component to be deployed on a separate mobile-only page without the cost of the official App Store, which Jason Bluth agreed was preferable ([01:13:09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.v6t1g9gkf6hs)) ([01:15:07](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.hg6ivd5flur5)). This mobile design would cater to end-users primarily accessing information on their phones ([01:14:18](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.rwmt9xb1cjnr)).

* **Multi-Substance Interaction Checking** Jason Bluth inquired about the tool's ability to map interactions of multiple substances, such as psilocybin with an SSRI or MAOI inhibitor ([01:15:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.c3fbcgrurdbi)). Admin explained that the system can only present combined interaction data if that information is already available in the library or database, stressing that the project will not conduct original research ([01:16:51](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.wr6k0oxqakmu)).

* **Augmented Intelligence Framework** Admin highlighted that the platform is a "research portal" designed to aggregate decentralized, unorganized data, which an AI tool had characterized as a form of augmented intelligence currently absent in the industry ([01:18:31](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.lg0aafimyfpt)). Jason Bluth acknowledged Admin's technical skill and delighted in the synergistic efforts driving the project ([01:19:33](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.f1koh4jp0zhr)) ([01:21:00](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.g5mg4pf5v61i)).

* **Missing Component and The Scientist Tier** Jason Bluth identified a "blind spot" in the development: the "scientist" tier, represented by figures like Dr. Allen and Dr. Vega, whose requirements and expertise in areas like Ibogaine use need to be integrated ([01:21:56](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.ygtuu24212xt)). He proposed that incorporating protocols from these experienced scientists would lend further legitimacy to the system, especially when presenting solutions to states ([01:23:35](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.3hvpd4krs1vy)) ([01:25:42](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.xzhzykp7ufz0)).

* **Meeting Logistics and Demonstration Access** Jason Bluth requested a sandbox or access to the live environment to prepare for a meeting with a practitioner named Sarah Honeyut the next day ([01:27:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.s5o7h95yqtsd)) ([01:29:09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.krjgwijiva3n)). Admin initially expressed reluctance due to security risks but agreed to work on deploying the app live, possibly for a month, which Jason Bluth offered to cover the cost for ([01:27:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.s5o7h95yqtsd)) ([01:40:36](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.nsb67zwi15nx)).

* **Patient Protocol Data Entry Demonstration** Admin demonstrated the speed of prepopulating a record using a test case and walked Jason Bluth through the data entry process for a new protocol, including patient demographics and therapy details. This included entering an anonymized ID based on birth year and month ([01:28:16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.e71eyl7l6w0d)) ([01:29:45](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.bhigbkqor7cd)).

* **Dosage Safety Alerts** The demo featured a dosage entry field with a caution warning if the entered amount exceeded the maximum clinical dosage, linking directly to the source of the standard ([01:32:27](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.h9jlomhlg8bw)). Jason Bluth noted that this type of logic, based on sources like double-blind placebo studies, aligns perfectly with the thinking of scientists like Dr. Allen and Dr. Vega ([01:33:22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.yu0fygwttpsa)).

* **Outcome Metrics and Adverse Events** Admin demonstrated how the system captures outcomes using metrics like the GAD score for anxiety and PHQ9 score, noting that it tracks adverse events and has informed consent requirements ([01:34:09](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.asjexpx51op4)). The entry for a new protocol submission failed due to a timeout, prompting a brief discussion on technical workarounds ([01:35:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.w9qhw18n7f9u)).

* **Metric Standardization for Patient Input** Jason Bluth suggested adding grams as a unit of measurement, particularly for non-clinician users ("parters") ([01:35:01](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.w9qhw18n7f9u)). Admin emphasized that the system adheres to medical community standards, typically using milligrams, and while they would prioritize the doctors' input, they agreed to "parking lot" the suggestion for non-clinician conversions ([01:36:13](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.5rx5db5m2ke6)).

* **Logistics for Tomorrow's Meeting** Jason Bluth arranged to set up a Google Meet at the coffee shop at 3:15 PM the next day to allow Admin to call in and demo the application to Sarah Honeyut, a practitioner currently using Althia ([01:36:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.k94971js7dq)) ([01:51:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.z35f8six8yfx)). Admin confirmed they would work on getting the application live and fixing the security issue that prevented the data from being stored and reflected on the chart during the current demo ([01:38:20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.xz3ytc3wopc2)) ([01:39:40](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.5nlpgjefrtem)).

* **Inclusion of Biosocial Questionnaire** Jason Bluth identified a procedural gap, suggesting the workflow needs an initial "biopsychosocial questionnaire" step, which would be sent as an anonymized link to the patient to prepopulate data before the patient demographic accordion ([01:42:34](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.g1prqab3w0un)). This feature would improve efficiency by aligning with the practitioners' current intake process and minimizing manual data entry ([01:50:58](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.458pf8l3tyew)).

* **HIPAA Compliance and API Friction** Admin warned that even the *capability* to collect patient health information (PHI) in the database infrastructure could compromise compliance, and noted that the system is not intended to replace EHR systems, but rather to collect anonymized treatment data ([01:47:26](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.op3yavim3u07)). Jason Bluth offered a solution for the biosocial intake: the system would create a non-identifiable number, send the questionnaire, receive the data, and then allow the clinician to print a hard copy of the data separately for their own records, ensuring the system remains anonymized ([01:48:28](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.rxulvam3xzh9)).

* **Front-End Starter for Clinicians** Admin embraced Jason Bluth’s idea to make the anonymized questionnaire the front-end "starter" for clinicians before they collect any PHI, increasing efficiency in their current process ([01:50:15](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.om0s21uuqph9)). Jason Bluth expressed high confidence that Sarah Honeyut, who finds the existing Althia software non-user-friendly, will be impressed by the ingenuity of the new system ([01:51:48](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.z35f8six8yfx)).

* **Research and Protocol Builder Updates** Admin outlined the initial steps, including researching the psilocybin therapy biopsychosocial questionnaire form data form schema to find the database, noting they had already located a CSV. They also addressed updates needed for the protocol builder, such as adding more biopsychodemographic information, updating the layout and fields, and improving the support modality tab order and tool tips, potentially updating the language for clarity. Calton also mentioned a required change to permission settings for the protocol builder unless it can go live tomorrow, as currently, being logged in is necessary to store records ([01:54:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.61uo2ypvclck)).

* **Interface Fixes and Site Functions** Admin identified several required fixes for the interface, including the header bar, the guided tour, and the search function located in the header bar. Additionally, Calton noted that the notifications and help functions need attention, and they questioned the mention of an "Anti-gravity physics engine". A new function on the site represented by a little chemistry flask requires an update to its sample data ([01:54:17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kE9PqBkefHfwCkix6J5DebDU83HkQ3zIdG-8Laxts8w/edit?tab=t.4rg4p8gijevw#heading=h.61uo2ypvclck)).

## **Admin : Jason : Sarah**

### **Summary**

Jason and Admin presented the Minimum Viable Product of the Psychedelic Practitioner Network (PPN), a tool for facilitating peer-to-peer decentralized research and protocol building, to Sarah, a psychedelic practitioner. The PPN, which is not an EHR and only stores non-personally identifiable information, was demonstrated to track protocols, outcomes, and drug-drug interactions, with Sarah providing feedback that the tool is "super cool" but suggested simplifying the interface for client trackers and focusing on core capabilities like aggregated drug-drug interaction data, dosing information, and outcome metrics. Key strategic recommendations from Sarah included establishing relationships with organizations conducting IBO gain research, targeting New Mexico, and implementing features for tracking molecule source, mystical experience scores, and practitioner demographics.

### **Details**

* **Introductions and Project Overview** The meeting began with introductions between Jason Bluth (NMLS \\\# 1724308), Admin, and Sarah, with Jason mentioning that they all share John as a friend . Jason introduced Sarah as someone familiar with Althia and practicing as a psychedelic practitioner in Oregon, and Admin as the driving force behind the technical side of the project, which is designed to be a fresh approach to a systemic medical view that was previously deemed not user-friendly . They are calling the project the Psychedelic Practitioner Network (PPN) and are presenting an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or beta version for feedback .

* **Project Goals and Scope** Jason explained that the project aims to facilitate peer-to-peer decentralized research by having practitioners feed information into the system, and that they developed a tool useful for subcontractors, 1099 employees, and clinic owners  . The system is tiered, with one tier for tracking patients (especially for those using paper records, like the singularism folks met in Utah) and another for clinicians and physicians focusing on protocol building . Admin clarified that the system is not an EHR (Electronic Health Record) system and does not store personal health information, with all inputs coming from reference tables powered by industry databases .

* **Benchmarking and Data Collection** Admin explained that the system is designed to help people benchmark and track protocols and outcomes at the patient, clinic, and network levels . Benchmarking allows practitioners, like Sarah, who is a facilitator, to compare treatment outcomes and protocols easily, especially since such comparison resources are currently scarce . The system only stores non-personally identifiable information such as age, weight range, gender, and race, alongside the protocol itself, while prohibiting text inputs to maintain compliance  .

* **Demonstration of the PPN Tool** Admin walked Sarah through the demo, starting with a Google-style search portal. The demonstration highlighted the inclusion of scientific data on seven psychedelics, including details on receptors and molecular weight, with links to reputable sources . Jason pointed out the affinity spider chart, which is currently configured for depression (PHQ9) to help practitioners select the optimal chemical for treatment planning based on targeted receptors .

* **Interactions and Protocol Input** Admin showcased an interaction checker feature that allows cross-referencing psychedelics with regular medications, such as psilocybin and lithium, for reference and training, with sources provided . The protocol intake process is anonymized, assigning a random 10-digit encrypted code based on the patient's birth month and year, and collects data using industry-sourced reference tables (like Snow Med codes) for defensibility . The form includes sections for therapeutic context, concomitant medications, protocol details (substance, dosage, administration route), and outcome metrics like PHQ9 score, resolution, and adverse events .

* **Patient Data and Compliance** Jason suggested that forms like the biosocial intake could be pre-populated by the patient once their randomized ID is created, minimizing data entry for the practitioner . Admin clarified that the system only pulls quantifiable fields from biosocial forms to prevent the system from growing out of control, and also noted that they will offer the practitioner the option to save or print the entered treatment protocol as a PDF, but they do not retain this data to remain HIPPA compliant. The lack of patient ID tracking means that if practitioners lose their look-up number, they cannot enter subsequent treatments for that patient, reinforcing the focus on research aggregation over medical record storage  .

* **Data Analysis and Benchmarking Features** Once data is entered, the system can track treatment protocols and outcomes, illustrating changes in scores (e.g., PHQ9 scores dropping from 25 to 12 after a second treatment) . Admin explained that the aggregated data will allow for analysis over time, including tracking legal and regulatory changes, and filtering news feeds by state, substance, and status . The system's real value lies in its ability to benchmark individual treatments or clinics against network and global averages, utilizing analytics to determine factors influencing outcomes such as substance type or patient medications .

* **Clinic Level Features and Data Integrity** Admin discussed potential clinic-level features, including tracking profitability and generating performance snapshots for staff meetings or boards of directors, which depends on the amount of information practitioners are willing to share . The system includes a quick dashboard for filtering patients by substance or safety warnings, and a neural engine for quick reference research outside of the database . For data integrity, every single entry will have a hash log, and data is stored using reference table numbers instead of actual treatment values, ensuring that only numerical codes are accessible if the data is compromised .

* **Initial Feedback from Sarah** Sarah found the tool "super cool" and the focus on drug-drug interactions, such as lithium and psilocybin, highly helpful, noting that these questions are commonly repeated by people using psilocybin . Sarah suggested that for someone just tracking clients, the system might be overwhelming due to its feature-rich nature, proposing a potential on/off switch or different views for client trackers versus clinicians. Sarah appreciated the collection of data on receptors being impacted by different drugs and the fact that the system does not collect PII .

* **Strategic Development Recommendations** Sarah strongly recommended that the team establish relationships with everyone conducting IBO gain research in the country, noting the substantial funding and legislative movement in that area . She also suggested targeting New Mexico, as they are developing a medical model and the PPN offers a distinct, protocol-based product compared to existing systems like Althia. Sarah proposed focusing on the PPN as a research portal now, with a potential commercial product later, and suggested collaborating with existing IBO gain clinics to inform protocols and safety  .

* **Refinements and Future Development** Jason acknowledged Sarah's concern about the system being overwhelming and suggested fine-tuning future reviews to focus on core capabilities for specific user groups, like simplifying it to a five-capability software for practitioners seeking to minimize paperwork . Admin emphasized that the goal is to minimize friction points for doctors by requiring less than 60 seconds to add a protocol, as the PPN is designed as a supplemental research tool, not an EHR replacement . Sarah also suggested removing the regulatory map, focusing on drug-drug interactions and dosing, and ensuring a way to report spiritual experiences, perhaps through mystical experience surveys for clients .

* **Advanced Tracking Capabilities** Sarah suggested features like batch tracking clinical numbers for grouping patients in trials and collecting data on positive/negative outcomes per facilitator/practitioner . Furthermore, she stressed the importance of tracking the source/producer of the molecule, noting that adverse outcomes might be traceable to a specific source. Jason confirmed that tracking the genus and source of psychedelics like psilocybin has been discussed, and Admin noted that many of Sarah's suggestions, including the mystical score and source tracking, are already in the works .

* **Product Features and Layout** Admin highlighted that tracking similar outcomes among users from a single producer is a unique function of their tool . Sarah suggested that information like news and regulatory maps should be saved for a newsletter or a secondary feature, not cluttering the main interface. Admin clarified that the original design used collapsible sections (accordions) to reduce visual business and emphasized that the current busy layout was merely for concept demonstration rather than the final design .

* **Need for Defined Use Cases and User Models** Jason emphasized the importance of fully defining use cases and user models, potentially multi-tiered, beyond the initial two conceived. They specifically asked Sarah, as a practitioner, to describe tools and usage that would assist them in working with clients from initial engagement through protocol finding .

* **Practitioner Tool Requirements: Drug Interactions and Data Collection** Sarah identified the critical need for aggregated drug-drug interaction information and robust reporting features. They explained that this reporting should include demographics, current medications, and the dose administered, along with the subsequent client reaction (e.g., "launched well" or a "not a super powerful trip") . Sarah noted this data is vital for resolving conflicting anecdotal advice, such as whether anti-nausea medication blunts the psychedelic experience, which is currently unknown .

* **Data Aggregation and Safety Considerations** Sarah proposed a system where practitioners would get access to drug-drug interaction and dosing information in exchange for entering anonymized client data (age, weight, gender/sex, ethnicity, medications, dose, and outcome) . They stressed the need for contraindication information to reduce practitioners' reliance on external medical professionals for prescription reviews, which can be costly . Sarah also highlighted the importance of including herbal supplements, like St. John's wort (a natural MAOI), in the assessment, as clients often do not report these natural products, which can lead to unexpectedly prolonged trips .

* **Protocol Matching and Expertise Filtering** Jason inquired if a dynamic portal where a practitioner could input client demographics and drug information and have it pull up matching protocols would be valuable . Sarah confirmed this would be helpful but stressed the need for a mechanism or filter to prevent inexperienced users from accessing or misinterpreting advanced protocols, such as those requiring physician-level access or involving substances like MDMA .

* **Biological and Cultural Differences in Experience** Sarah shared anecdotal evidence suggesting that people from Asian cultures experience high-magnitude, negative outcomes, prompting questions about potential allergies or unknown receptors . Jason agreed this biological factor is crucial to capture, relating it to known differences in how various cultures metabolize substances like alcohol . They both discussed incorporating genome or region-specific data (e.g., sourcing mushroom strains native to a client's region) to address these biological differences .

* **Post-Journey Follow-up and Practitioner Demographics** Sarah emphasized that measuring the success of a trip needs to be tracked over time, as clients who initially hate a journey may feel positive benefits two weeks later, which is important for practitioners to know . Additionally, Sarah suggested collecting practitioner demographics to understand how a facilitator's background might affect client outcomes and trust, noting they often find sharing some personal history beneficial for client connection . Sarah also noted the importance of tracking a client's history of psychedelic use, as experienced users handle challenging trips differently .
