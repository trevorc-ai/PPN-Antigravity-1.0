## Inside the PPN Portal Roadmap: Why This ‘Dry’ Doc Reads Like a Thriller

**Speaker 5:** Welcome back to the Deep Dive. It is Thursday, February 12th, 2026, and today we're doing something a little bit different. 

**Speaker 6:** Yeah, we are. 

**Speaker 5:** Usually we're looking at a, you know, a finished product or a published study, but today we are really looking under the hood of a business in motion. We've got our hands on a strategic internal document.

It's titled Use Cases, PPN, portal Roadmap. 

**Speaker 6:** It sounds kind of dry, doesn't it? Yeah. Roadmap. But when you actually read this thing, it's, 

**Speaker 5:** yeah, 

**Speaker 6:** it reads more like a thriller or maybe a rescue mission. 

**Speaker 5:** Exactly. It feels like we're looking at a state of the union address for a company that's at this, uh, massive crossroads.

**Speaker 6:** Right? 

**Speaker 5:** On one hand, they've built some incredibly sophisticated tech, but on the other hand. 


## The 65% Alignment Wake‑Up Call: Built a Ferrari, Users Need a Jeep

**Speaker 5:** There is a number on page one that just stops you in your tracks. 

**Speaker 6:** You're talking about the strategic alignment score, 

**Speaker 5:** right? It's sitting at 65%. Now, if I got a 65% on a test in school, my parents would've grounded me.

But for a tech company, what does that actually mean? 

**Speaker 6:** It means you built a Ferrari, but your customer lives on a dirt road. Really needs a Jeep. It suggests they built what they thought the industry needed, you know, high-end data tools, but they missed what practitioners are actually screaming for, 

**Speaker 5:** and what is that 

**Speaker 6:** help with their daily survival.

**Speaker 5:** So the mission for this deep dive is to unpack how this company, PPN Portal. Plans to fix that. They're pivoting from being a data tool to becoming the operating system for psychedelic practice, 

**Speaker 6:** and the stakes are huge. 

**Speaker 5:** Oh, absolutely. We're talking about a plan to double their revenue potential to over $2.4 million in annual recurring revenue.

**Speaker 6:** And to get there, they have to solve what the document calls three bleeding neck pain points. And I love that term, bleeding neck. It implies this isn't just an annoyance, you know, like a mosquito bite. 

**Speaker 5:** No, 

**Speaker 6:** this is life or death for these clinics. 


## What PPN Portal Does Today: Point Solutions for Data, Safety, and Benchmarking

**Speaker 5:** So let's set the scene. It's early 2026. What does PPN portal actually do right now?

Because they haven't been doing nothing, they have shipped product. 

**Speaker 6:** They have, and to be fair, what they've built is high quality. The document lists the current state. They have a protocol builder for, um, fast clinical data entry. 

**Speaker 5:** Okay. 

**Speaker 6:** They have a clinical intelligence platform for benchmarking outcomes against other clinics and.

They have safety surveillance for tracking adverse events, 

**Speaker 5:** which all sounds very responsible. I mean, if you're administering powerful psychedelics, you need to track safety. You absolutely need to know if your outcomes are good. 

**Speaker 6:** Absolutely. They also have an interaction checker for drugs and a data export feature.

These are what we call point solutions. They solve very specific isolated problems, 

**Speaker 5:** so if you just need to check a drug interaction, this tool is great. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 5:** Okay, so if the tools are good, why is the alignment score a D minus? Why are the users unhappy? 

**Speaker 6:** It's because of the so what factor? The analysis in the document points out a really critical gap.

These tools handle data. They help you analyze what happened after the session, or check safety before it. But they don't handle the workflow. Ah, they don't help the practitioner get through the chaos of their actual day. 


## Pain Point \#1 — The ‘Frankenstein Stack’ and Admin Burnout

**Speaker 5:** And that brings us to the first massive pain point from their voice of customer research.

This is the stuff that jumped out at me. There's a quote here from a user that just says, administrative burnout from fragmented tools is killing us. 

**Speaker 6:** That is the sound. Of a customer who is ready to cancel their subscription. And when you look at what they're dealing with, I mean, it makes total sense. The document calls it the Frankenstein stack.

**Speaker 5:** The Frankenstein stack. I love that image. It's like they've stitched together this monster just to get through the day, break that down for us. 

**Speaker 6:** So it's a digital nightmare to run a single patient through therapy. They're patching together four or five completely disconnected tools 

**Speaker 5:** like wood. 

**Speaker 6:** They're using IntakeQ.

For their intake forms. Then they switch tabs to spruce for secure messaging. Then they open Excel to track clinical outcomes manually. Then maybe simple practice for the calendar and then Oz mine for something else. 

**Speaker 5:** That sounds exhausting. Just listening to it. 

**Speaker 6:** It is, and the document puts a number on it.

They call it context switching. Every time you switch tabs or log into a new system, your brain has to, you know, recalibrate it breaks your flow, 

**Speaker 5:** right? 

**Speaker 6:** They estimate this Frankenstein approach is costing practitioners five to 10 hours a week. 

**Speaker 5:** That's a full workday. Just lost to clicking between tabs and trying to remember passwords.

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. 


## From Tool to Operating System: One Tab to Run the Whole Clinic

**Speaker 6:** That is why the strategic opportunity here is to build an operating system. The idea is instead of being one of five tabs open on the browser, PPN portal wants to be the only tab open 

**Speaker 5:** like the iPhone. You don't carry a calculator, a camera, A GPS, and a phone anymore. You just carry the iPhone 

**Speaker 6:** precisely.

And the business logic behind that is really compelling. If you're just a data tool, you're competing for a small slice of the budget. The document notes, they're currently charging about what, $399 a month, 

**Speaker 5:** which is a decent chunk of change. But if it's just for data, it's arguably a luxury. 

**Speaker 6:** Right? But if you're the operating system, if you handle scheduling, billing, messaging, intake, you're the backbone of the business.

You can charge $999 a month, but more importantly, you expand your total addressable market, your tam. You aren't just selling to the data nerds who love charts. You're selling to every single practitioner who just wants to run a business. 

**Speaker 5:** And let's talk about the stickiness factor, because I imagine once you're the os, it's hard to break up.

**Speaker 6:** It's nearly impossible if I just store my clinical data in your system. Sure, I can export a CSV file and leave. If my entire billing history, my patient calendar, my client messaging logs, all of it is woven into your platform. 

**Speaker 5:** You're not going anywhere. 

**Speaker 6:** I am never leaving. The switching costs are astronomically high.

You effectively own their workflow. 

**Speaker 5:** So to fix this Frankenstein nightmare, they're proposing a whole new set of use cases basically to eat the whole stack. 

**Speaker 6:** They do. And that's ambitious. But according to this document, it's the number one pain point. If they don't fix this, they just remain a nice to have and in a tight market, nice to haves, get cut, 

**Speaker 5:** must have stay.

Okay. 


## Pain Point \#2 — Practitioner Isolation & the Supervision Marketplace (Use Case 13)

**Speaker 5:** Let's move to pain point number two. And this one feels a lot more human. It's less about efficiency and more about the, uh. Emotional reality of the job. 

**Speaker 6:** Yeah. This one is really poignant. The quote here is, I feel isolated. The unique challenges of psychedelic assisted therapy require specialized supervision.

That's hard to find. 

**Speaker 5:** It makes sense. You're doing this intense work dealing with trauma. Often in a small private practice, you don't have colleagues down the hall to debrief with, 

**Speaker 6:** and right now. The current reality described in the document is pretty bleak. There is no centralized marketplace. 

**Speaker 5:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 6:** If you want supervision or mentorship, where do you even go?

The document says people are relying on underground telegram or signal groups. 

**Speaker 5:** That sounds incredibly sketchy for a medical profession. Find your supervisor on telegram. 

**Speaker 6:** It sounds like you're buying something illicit, not seeking professional guidance. 

**Speaker 5:** Right. It's a liability nightmare and a quality control disaster.

Or on the flip side, you're paying these exorbitant consultation fees, 200 to $400 an hour if you can even find someone who's qualified. 

**Speaker 6:** So there's this cliff people fall off of after they get certified, 

**Speaker 5:** a post certification cliff. They get trained and then they're just abandoned. 

**Speaker 6:** So what's PTN Portal solution here?

This is use case 13. They're building a supervision marketplace. But it's not just a phone book. They're talking about using AI for diet matching. 

**Speaker 5:** Diet matching. Unpack that for me. 

**Speaker 6:** It means matching mentors and mentees based on compatibility, on style, on specific needs. It's like a dating app for professional supervision.

**Speaker 5:** Hmm. 

**Speaker 6:** Not just who is available at 2:00 PM but who works with the same modalities I do. 

**Speaker 5:** Who has experience with my patient population. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. 

**Speaker 5:** And they're also talking about supervision circles. Right? Groups of four to six practitioners, 

**Speaker 6:** which is brilliant economics. It lowers the cost for the individual, making it affordable while keeping the revenue high for the supervisor.

Uh, but from a business strategy perspective, this is genius because it creates a viral loop. 

**Speaker 5:** I love a good viral loop. 

**Speaker 6:** Mm-hmm. 

**Speaker 5:** How does it work in this context? 

**Speaker 6:** Well, think about it. If I'm a supervisor on the platform, I would invite all my supervisees to join the platform. I essentially become a sales agent for PPM 

**Speaker 5:** and practitioners will invite their colleagues to their circle.

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. It turns the user base into a Salesforce, 

**Speaker 5:** plus they get to take a cut. The document mentions a 20% fee on supervision transactions. That is a completely new revenue stream that has nothing to do with software subscription. 

**Speaker 6:** Right. It diversifies the business model so they aren't just reliant on sauce fees.

**Speaker 5:** Okay. 


## Pain Point \#3 — Integration After Dosing: Using the Neuroplasticity Window (Use Case 14)

**Speaker 5:** Let's talk about the third bleeding neck pain point and this one. This one feels like a critique of the entire industry. The quote is, ketamine works really well, but the ketamine industry doesn't. 

**Speaker 6:** That is a brutal line, but it reflects a reality where clinics are just focused on drug delivery. 

**Speaker 5:** Yeah.

**Speaker 6:** You come in, you get your infusion, you leave the document notes that this leads to client churn rates of 60 to 70%. 

**Speaker 5:** That is massive churn. You're losing two thirds of your patients after the initial treatment 

**Speaker 6:** because they aren't getting the support they need to make the changes stick. The document talks about the neuroplasticity window.

**Speaker 5:** Right. Let's unpack that. This is the two to three weeks after a session. Yeah. 

**Speaker 6:** Yes. Biologically, the brain is more malleable during that time. It's the prime time to form new habits, change thought patterns, break old addictions. But currently that window is just being wasted. 

**Speaker 5:** So the clinic provides the drug, opens the window.

Then just walks away 

**Speaker 6:** effectively, yes, they're planting seeds, but forgetting to water them, and that's where use case 14 comes in. Integration tools. 

**Speaker 5:** What does that actually look like in the app? 

**Speaker 6:** It's things like, uh, automated homework templates, progress tracking and specific alerts for that neuroplasticity window.

Imagine the system automatically prompting the patient to journal three days post session. 

**Speaker 5:** Or flagging the therapist if the patient's mood score drops. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. It's about moving from, we give you a drug to, we are managing your transformation. 

**Speaker 5:** Financially, this is huge. The document says integration services can generate two to three times the revenue of the dosing sessions themselves, 

**Speaker 6:** which turns the economics of the clinic upside down in the best way.

Instead of constantly hunting for new patients, which is expensive. You're keeping your existing patients engaged and billing for the integration work. It reduces churn and increases lifetime value. 

**Speaker 5:** So those are the big three, workflow, isolation and integration, but the roadmap doesn't stop there. 


## Tier-One Add‑Ons: Liability Suite, Training Integration, and Multi‑Site Dashboards

**Speaker 5:** There's this section on tier one strategic add-ons that I found fascinating.

These aren't just daily annoyances. They address deep fears. 

**Speaker 6:** Fear is a great motivator and the biggest fear for any practitioner is liability use. Case seven is the liability protection suite. 

**Speaker 5:** The quote here is, if outcomes are inconsistent, I will be blamed. Or sued, 

**Speaker 6:** which is a valid fear in a new, you know, somewhat stigmatized industry.

So PPN is proposing audit ready documentation. The system would auto generate narrative charts and create a safety event. Chain of custody. 

**Speaker 5:** Chain of custody sounds very CSI. 

**Speaker 6:** It basically means immutable logs. If something goes wrong, you can prove exactly what you did when you did it, and that you followed protocol.

It's legal armor 

**Speaker 5:** and the barrier to entry here has to be high, right? You can't just code this over a weekend. 

**Speaker 6:** No, you need legal review. You need templates for different jurisdictions. That creates a moat. If PPN build this, it's very hard for a competitor to just copy it quickly. 

**Speaker 5:** Then there's use case eight training integration.

This seems like a play for the very beginning of the practitioner's journey. 

**Speaker 6:** It is. They want to integrate with state programs, specifically mentioning Colorado Dare I and Oregon, 

**Speaker 5:** which are the two big regulated markets right now. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. They wanna offer competency tracking and CEU credit systems directly in the platform.

But the growth strategy here is what's clever. They want to sell to cohorts. 

**Speaker 5:** So instead of selling to one doctor at a time, you sell to an entire training program, 

**Speaker 6:** right? You sell to a program for five or $10,000 a cohort. Suddenly you have 30 new practitioners who are trained on your software from day one.

**Speaker 5:** So by the time they graduate, they already know how to use PPN. 

**Speaker 6:** They aren't gonna go buy something else. It's the Adobe strategy. Get the students hooked 

**Speaker 5:** and quickly the last tier one add-on the multi-site dashboard. 

**Speaker 6:** This is for the big fish. The operators running 50 to hundred clinics. Their problem is they can't compare clinic A to clinic B.

PPN wants to build a dashboard that benchmarks them against each other. 

**Speaker 5:** So if clinic A is getting 20% better outcomes than clinic B, you wanna know why 

**Speaker 6:** exactly this tool tells you it brings the franchise model. To therapy. 


## Execution Roadmap 2026: Q1 Foundation, Q2 Hybrid Sprints, Q4 Insurance

**Speaker 5:** So we have the, the operating system. We have the why, the pain points. Now let's look at the when the execution roadmap for 2026, because ideas are cheap.

Execution is everything. 

**Speaker 6:** This is where the rubber meets the road. They've broken the year down into quarters 

**Speaker 5:** Q1, which is where we are now. Finish protocol builder and clinical intelligence, MVP. 

**Speaker 6:** This is the foundation. You have to have the data tools working before you can build the fancy stuff. They actually have a demo with a Dr.

Sheena coming up on Feb 15th, just a few days from now in the documents timeline. 

**Speaker 5:** Then Q2, April to June, this is where they make a critical decision. They're calling it the hybrid approach. 

**Speaker 6:** Yeah. This is interesting. They realize they can't just do one thing at a time. So the core team keeps building the intelligence platform, but the spinning up sprint teams to tackle the liability and training pain points simultaneously.

**Speaker 5:** So they're trying to move fast. They're parallel processing, 

**Speaker 6:** they have to, the voice of customer data is screaming that people are burning out. You can't tell a practitioner who's burning out, wait until Q4 for help. 

**Speaker 5:** They need to show progress now. 

**Speaker 6:** Right. And speaking of Q4, that is when they tackle insurance tools and integration.

**Speaker 5:** Ah, insurance. The whale. 

**Speaker 6:** The whale. It takes the longest to build, which is why it's later in the year. It's complex, bureaucratic, messy. But once you unlock insurance reimbursement. The market just explodes. 


## Build vs Buy: Partner for Commodities, Build the Moat Features

**Speaker 5:** One thing I noticed in the strategy section is the build versus buy philosophy. They aren't trying to build everything from scratch, are they?

**Speaker 6:** No, and that's crucial. If they tried to build their own video conferencing tool or their own billing processor, they'd fail. The strategy is build what differentiates partner for what is commoditized. 

**Speaker 5:** So use Calendly for scheduling. Use Stripe for billing. Use Twilio for messaging. 

**Speaker 6:** Exactly. Don't reinvent the wheel.

Just integrate the wheel into your car. 

**Speaker 5:** Yeah. 

**Speaker 6:** Things like the supervision marketplace or the liability templates, you have to build those yourself because that's where your unique value lies. 


## The Numbers: Doubling ARR with Platform Pricing \+ New Revenue Streams

**Speaker 5:** Let's talk numbers. The financial section. This is the argument for why this pivot is worth the risk. 

**Speaker 6:** It's a pretty stark comparison.

The current model selling, just the protocol builder, gets them to about 1.2 million in annual recurring revenue, 

**Speaker 5:** which isn't bad. It's a respectable small business. 

**Speaker 6:** It's fine. The expanded platform model. That projects out to 2.44 million. It literally doubles the revenue, 

**Speaker 5:** and that's coming from a mix of higher subscription fees, moving from $399 to $999 plus all these add-ons, 

**Speaker 6:** right?

Supervision fees, liability, add-ons, multi-site fees. And remember the strategic argument. A platform has a three x larger total addressable market. If you're a benchmarking tool, you only appeal to data-driven clinics. If you're the operating system, you appeal to everyone. 

**Speaker 5:** Plus the investor story is just so much better.

We are the OS for the industry is a much easier sell than we make a nice data entry form 

**Speaker 6:** 100%, and it justifies the platform decision. The document explicitly recommends the platform route. Because of that higher pricing power and the higher switching costs. Investors love a defensible business and a platform is much more defensible than a tool.


## Next Actions, Big Takeaway, and the Provocative ‘Platform as Regulator’ Question

**Speaker 5:** So what happens next? The document ends with immediate next actions for this week, February 12th to the 16th. 

**Speaker 6:** They're moving fast. The lead needs to get user approval on these use cases. This week, the designer is already supposed to be creating wire frames for the liability protection. 

**Speaker 5:** It feels urgent. 

**Speaker 6:** It is urgent.

They've identified that their strategic alignment is only 65% in the startup world. If you aren't aligned with your user's needs, you die. They're correcting the course in real time. 

**Speaker 5:** So let's wrap this up. What is the big takeaway here for our listeners? 

**Speaker 6:** The takeaway is that PPM portal is realizing that data is not enough.

You can have the best data in the world, but if the practitioner is burning out from administrative chaos. The data doesn't matter. They're moving from a tool that tracks therapy to a system that enables the business of therapy. Yeah. It's a shift from the theoretical to the practical. 

**Speaker 5:** Exactly. By addressing the unsexy problems, billing, liability, scheduling.

They're actually. Unlocking the ability to improve clinical outcomes. You can't have good integration therapy if your system doesn't remind the patient to do their homework. 

**Speaker 6:** It reminds me of that saying, amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics. This roadmap is all about logistics. It's about the plumbing that makes the house livable.

**Speaker 5:** Here's my provocative closing thought for you. If this platform succeeds. If PPN becomes the operating system for everyone, they handle the training, the liability, the supervision, the data, do they eventually become the primary regulator of the industry by default? 

**Speaker 6:** That's a fascinating question. 

**Speaker 5:** I mean, if they hold all the data and set the verification standards for who gets to be on the platform, 

**Speaker 6:** yeah, 

**Speaker 5:** they might have more power than the state boards.

**Speaker 6:** If you get kicked off the platform, you might effectively be out of business. Yeah. In a fragmented industry, the platform that organizes the chaos often becomes the defacto law. If PPN sets the standard for what a safe session looks like in their code, that becomes the industry standard. It's definitely a possibility, 

**Speaker 5:** something to chew on, power flows to the platform.


## Closing: The Future of Psychedelic Practice and What Comes Next

**Speaker 5:** That's it for this deep dive into the PPN Portal roadmap. Thanks for joining us on this journey into the future of psychedelic practice. 

**Speaker 6:** Always a pleasure. 

**Speaker 5:** We'll see you next time.
