Based on Dr. Jason Allen's complete transcript, here's a detailed bullet point outline of his comments and questions with additional context:

## **Screen Sharing & Technical Setup**

* Platform inquiry: Asked whether the interface is iOS, tablet, or Android \- showing interest in cross-platform compatibility

## **Pharmacology & Research Expertise**

### **Substances & Receptor Affinity**

* Initial compounds mentioned: Confirmed knowledge of Ketamine and MDMA  
* Ibogaine research focus: Expressed strong curiosity about receptor affinity data for Iboga in the system  
  * Currently conducting "pretty intense research" on ibogaine  
  * Notes that ibogaine has "the widest spectrum neuropsychopharmacology" with receptors not yet fully understood  
  * Specifically mentioned 5-HT2A receptor (serotonin receptor critical in psychedelic effects)

### **Medication Interactions & Contraindications**

* Lithium concern: Noted that lithium and 5-HT2A receptors are "a common one" \- referring to dangerous drug interactions  
* Buprenorphine/Suboxone: Identified this as an important medication to track (opioid dependency treatment)  
  * Spelled it out: S-U-B-O-X-O-N-E  
* Benzodiazepines: Suggested writing "benzos just as a group" for efficiency  
* Drug interaction resources: Emphasized the importance of having quick access to pharmacological information during sessions

## **User Interface & Workflow Feedback**

### **Data Input & Forms**

* Unit conversion concern: Highlighted the common mistake of pounds vs. kilograms conversion \- suggested automatic conversion to prevent errors  
* File upload capability: Asked multiple times about uploading consent forms directly into the system rather than just clicking "I have consent"  
* Flexible input fields: Wanted to know if there's free-text input beyond dropdown menus when selecting "other" options

### **Multi-Session Management**

* Concurrent session question: Asked if he can use the same app across three different rooms with three different people simultaneously  
  * Closing and reopening for each session  
* Ideal setup: Mentioned having an iPad in each room for optimal workflow

### **Data Collection Methods**

* Subjective vs. Objective data distinction:  
  * Subjective: Verbal check-ins with patients  
  * Objective: Using machinery (handhelds or automated monitoring devices)

### **Baseline Monitoring**

* EKG addition request: Asked to add EKG to baseline measurements \- noting this is "pretty normal" standard of care

## **Privacy & Data Considerations**

* De-identification: Confirmed understanding that patient data should not be identified  
* Access to aggregated data: Asked about how outsiders or newcomers to psychedelic treatment could view collected/aggregated data  
  * Thinking about the tool's value for education and onboarding new practitioners

## **Clinical Session Management**

### **Booster Dosing Protocol**

* Booster timing tracking: Important feature request for tracking redosing during sessions  
  * Example: Booster one hour into session, or two hours in  
  * Noted this is "a pretty common theme" in psychedelic-assisted therapy  
  * Valuable for new practitioners: This decision-making data would help people new to the field

### **Dosing Complexity ("The Trifecta")**

* Multi-agent protocols: Explained that clinical sessions typically use 2-4 different agents (not just one substance)  
* Longitudinal decision-making: The hardest part is the protocol for when and how to redose  
* Psilocybin exception: Macro-dose psilocybin is "pretty straightforward" compared to other protocols  
* MDMA example: Referenced Trevor's statement that "MDMA changed my life" \- noting it likely wasn't one dose but multiple boosters either in one session or spaced over time

### **Dosing Calculations (Ibogaine-Specific)**

* Running dose calculation request: Wants automatic calculation of cumulative dose and milligrams per kilogram throughout session  
  * Example scenario: Starting dose 100mg, second dose 550mg \= 650mg total  
  * Should automatically calculate: 12.1 mg/kg based on patient body weight  
* Column structure suggestion:  
  * Time | Substance (e.g., ibogaine) | Dose amount | Weight in kg | mg/kg calculation  
  * Running calculation so he can monitor total exposure at any point (e.g., "I'm 12 hours in at 16.5 mg/kg, I know I have room to go up to 22 mg/kg")

### **Ibogaine-Specific Protocols**

* Session duration: Mentioned 30-hour ibogaine sessions  
  * extraordinarily long compared to other psychedelics  
* Two compound variants:  
  * Ibogaine chloride (pure compound)  
  * Ibogaine TPA (Total Plant Alkaloids \- approximately 80% ibogaine content)  
* Dosing range context: Mentioned therapeutic window between \~16.5 mg/kg up to 22 mg/kg

## **Cardiac Safety & Monitoring**

### **QT Interval Monitoring (Critical Safety Feature)**

* Non-negotiable safety requirement: "If anybody's using ibogaine and not running an EKG, they're doing it wrong. Period."  
* What is QT interval: Time between heartbeats on EKG \- can become prolonged with ibogaine  
* Cardiac arrhythmia risk: The primary cardiac concern with ibogaine  
* Historical context: 33 recorded deaths on ibogaine in 70 years  
  * Almost all involve polypharmacy (multiple drugs)  
  * Most were non-evaluated cases  
  * All were cardiac-related deaths

### **QT Measurement Methodology**

* Multiple calculation methods exist:  
  * Simpson methodology  
  * Pearson methodology  
  * Others  
* Equipment variation: Different EKG machinery may calculate QT differently  
* Data collection request: Wants to run correlation between two different systems to contribute to field research  
* Clinical implication: Knowing which QT calculation method different EKG devices use (like LifePack monitors) is important for standardization

### **Vital Signs Monitoring**

* Blood pressure  
* Heart rate  
* Respiratory rate  
* QT interval (emphasized as most important for ibogaine)

## **Technology & Tools**

### **Device Preferences**

* Currently using laptops and paper forms  
* Has an iPad available for use

### **Browser Compatibility**

* Asked about: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility

### **Resource Integration**

* Hyperlink suggestion: Wants quick access to drug interaction resources without leaving the app  
  * Currently would need to switch to ChatGPT or Medline database  
  * Suggested a floating tab or search icon accessible from any page  
  * Wants to quickly ask questions about compound interactions in real-time

## **Implementation & Testing Plans**

### **Pilot Testing Timeline**

* Meeting reference: Has integration practitioner group meeting Thursday evening  
* First live test: Plans to pilot test the system as soon as Friday (very soon)  
* Session details: At least 2 people in session Friday at 9:00 AM start time  
* Parallel approach: Will run paper forms alongside the digital system for comparison and backup  
  * This parallel tracking will clearly show what information is most important to capture

### **Learning Approach**

* Tactile/visceral learner: Needs hands-on experience \- "It's hard to know, it's still two-dimensional"  
* Prefers familiarization: Wants to explore the system before showing it off publicly (not just see it for first time during live use)

## **Clinical Team Structure**

* Multiple practitioners working simultaneously  
* Multiple clients in concurrent sessions  
* Uses team-based approach with integration practitioners

## **Overall Assessment & Motivation**

### **Positive Feedback**

* "It looks great, Trevor"  
* "No, it looks fantastic"  
* "It's really a safety issue, and it's really nice to see this"  
* "Well, it's already better than I could have imagined"  
* "Boy, you've got some experience with this. That was really fast to put this together"  
* "This stuff is gonna make it safer for people to be able to do this work, which is gonna make the world a better place"

### **Professional Values**

* Patient care over politics: Would "rather do the patient care stuff than this \[administrative work\]"  
* Safety-focused: Emphasized multiple times that the tool will improve safety  
* Field advancement: Wants to contribute data that will help establish standards and educate new practitioners  
* Collaborative: Offered to send research papers and stay connected for ongoing development

### **Practical Mindset**

* Acknowledged the tool addresses real-world minutiae that causes errors  
* Values automation of calculations to remove human error  
* Recognizes need for both clinical utility and research data collection  
* Understands the balance between ideal features and practical implementation

## **Additional Resources Shared**

* Texted contact information: Shared email and phone number  
* Sent research article: Adobe note/article summarizing their ibogaine work, particularly QT interval monitoring protocols

This outline captures Dr. Jason Allen's role as an experienced psychedelic medicine practitioner focused on safety protocols, particularly with ibogaine therapy, who is evaluating a clinical monitoring tool for both immediate use and contribution to field-wide research standards.
