*This revised version incorporates recent advances in the scientific literature and insights gained through  increased clinical experience.* 

**Abstract** 

The re-emergence of psychedelic therapy in clinical research and practice has opened new  avenues for treating individuals with treatment-resistant psychiatric conditions. This article  presents the clinical reflections of a board-certified family physician drawing on more than 600  video-documented sessions involving psychedelic substances over seven years. The subjects undergoing the sessions include other physicians of multiple specialties as well as psychiatrists and psychoanalytically trained therapists. The discussion explores the therapeutic potential and  associated risks of three primary classes of psychedelics: phenethylamines, tryptamines, and  ibogaine, and offers practical strategies for medical risk mitigation and integrative care. The  article advocates for patient-centered models that emphasize safety, preparation, and long-term  integration. 

**Introduction** 

Psychedelics are increasingly recognized as promising interventions for post-traumatic stress  disorder (PTSD), depression, addiction, and existential distress. The three major classes of  psychedelic substances include phenethylamines (e.g., MDMA), tryptamines (e.g., psilocybin,  DMT), and the atypical indole alkaloid, ibogaine. Each class carries a distinct therapeutic profile  and risk spectrum, both physiological and psychological, that must be thoughtfully navigated in  clinical practice. 

**Phenethylamines** 

MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), a prototypical phenethylamine, has  demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of PTSD (Mithoefer et al., 2011). Its hallmark effects  include increased empathy, emotional openness, and interpersonal trust, all of which facilitate  therapeutic breakthroughs. 

The physiological effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) are primarily  attributable to its potent sympathomimetic activity. Common physiological responses include  increased heart rate, elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, enhanced myocardial oxygen  demand, hyperreflexia, mydriasis, hyperthermia, and diaphoresis. MDMA administration also  induces elevations in plasma cortisol and prolactin concentrations. Other commonly used phenethylamines with similar characteristics are MDA, 2-CB, and mescaline (peyote, San  Pedro), the latter two being more classic serotonergic phenethylamines.

   
In certain cases, these physiological effects may become exaggerated, resulting in complications  such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, severe hyperthermia, or seizures. Under  controlled clinical conditions, such reactions are uncommon and are generally well managed  through appropriate monitoring and supportive interventions. In contrast, recreational use, often characterized by uncontrolled dosing, concomitant substance use, dehydration, and prolonged  exertion, is associated with a substantially higher and less predictable risk profile. 

***Phenethylamines and serotonin syndrome*** 

The principal physiological safety concern in MDMA-assisted therapy is the potential for  serotonin toxicity (serotonin syndrome), particularly in individuals concurrently using  monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). 

Although doses up to **2 mg/kg** have been administered safely, consistent with regimens reported  by some underground practitioners, MDMA exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics. Consequently, plasma concentrations and physiological responses may increase  disproportionately at higher doses, complicating risk assessment and emphasizing the need for  careful titration and monitoring in all therapeutic settings. In my practice I have seen many  patients with MDMA stories unrelated to my sessions. One such anecdote reports a 88 kg young  man (K.K.) who 18 years prior: 

Took 1.7 grams (19 mg/kg) in college in 2007 before he realized the scale was off and read 0.2 grams. He was in  and out of a coma for 18 hours at home by himself. He didn't have a good care. Followed by terrible short-term  memory loss for one year. Fully recovered short-term memory. Repeat use of MDMA resulted in a non response since then. Antidepressants also have no effect on him. 

Immediate management of serotonin syndrome includes the administration of a benzodiazepine to control agitation and muscle rigidity, thereby reducing excessive muscular activity and  preventing hyperthermia. External cooling measures should be implemented as needed,  particularly when body temperature exceeds 39.5°C to 40.0°C. If symptoms are not adequately  controlled with supportive therapy alone, cyproheptadine, a serotonin 5-HT₂A receptor  antagonist, may be administered to further reduce serotonergic activity. (Boyer et al, NEJM,  2005\) 

Cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors including many SSRIs and antipsychotics can significantly  elevate plasma levels of MDMA (de la Torre et al., 2012), further increasing the risk of adverse  effects. Common drugs that inhibit CYPD2D6 are: 

**Strong Inhibitors** 

• Paroxetine   
• Fluoxetine   
• Quinidine   
• Methadone (in higher doses)   
• Propafenone 

• Terbinafine   
• Chlorpromazine

   
**Moderate Inhibitors** 

• Cinacalcet   
• Duloxetine   
• Fluvoxamine   
• Mirabegron   
• Fluphenazine   
• Haldoperidol   
• Clozapine 

**Weak Inhibitors** 

• Cimetidine   
• Sertraline   
• Ritonavir   
• Desvenlafaxine   
• Escitalopram   
• Celecoxib   
• Cobazam 

Although SSRIs can inhibit CYP2D6 enzymes, the primary concern with concomitant use is not  metabolic inhibition but rather the blunting of MDMA’s psychological effects while potentially  preserving or augmenting its peripheral physiologic effects. At clinical or typical recreational  doses, MDMA is associated with a significant risk of serotonin syndrome primarily when  combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), whereas this risk is substantially lower  with SSRIs. 

Clonus, a hallmark feature of serotonin syndrome, is commonly observed at standard therapeutic  doses of MDMA and serves in my practice as an indicator of pharmacologic/physiologic intensity rather than toxicity. 

Routine monitoring during sessions includes continuous assessment of cardiac rhythm,  respiratory patterns, and neurological signs such as clonus, saccadic eye movements, and  diaphoresis. Additional physiological parameters, such as blood pressure and temperature, are  assessed when clinically indicated. These metrics help determine the pharmacologic depth of the  experience, as distinct from its psychological depth. 

Psychological risks include acute anxiety and dissociation, particularly in individuals with rigid  ego structures or untreated personality disorders. I have found that minimizing verbal interaction  and encouraging an inward-focused orientation enables patients to access what often becomes  the essential core of the experience. In my view, the long-term benefits of MDMA therapy are  more closely associated with the depth of subjective experience than with the pharmacologic  action alone. 

In my clinical practice, a phenethylamine, typically MDMA, is often followed within the same  session by the administration of tryptamines, specifically psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT. This 

   
sequencing is based on findings from the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies  (MAPS), which indicate that therapeutic outcomes in psychedelic-assisted therapy are strongly  correlated with the intensity of the mystical experience, as measured by the Mystical Experience  Questionnaire (MEQ). 

In cases where patients present with strongly defended psychological organization or  demonstrate resistance to psychological breakthrough, ketamine may be used as an adjunct to  facilitate access to deeper emotional or transpersonal material. Although most participants  approach these medicines with the intention of yielding fully to the experience, individuals with  more deeply ingrained defense patterns may find it more difficult to relinquish control. This  challenge is particularly pronounced among individuals with personality disorders, which are  often rooted in early and deeper, pre-verbal trauma that impairs one’s capacity to trust, let go,  and integrate the experience.  

Practically speaking, combining these medicines increases the likelihood of a transformative  experience. As many practitioners have observed, not every MDMA session reaches the depth  necessary for significant psychological breakthroughs. The addition of psilocybin or 5-MeO DMT appears to enhance that potential. 

5-MeO-DMT, a powerful and fast-acting tryptamine, often induces deeply transformative  experiences, whether used alone or in combination with a phenethylamine. However, outcomes  can vary widely. Each person’s experience is unique. Some individuals have only a minimal  response, which can feel disappointing when accompanied by high expectations. For others, the  experience of ego dissolution can initially be unsettling or even frightening. Yet for those who  fully surrender to it, the temporary “death” of the ego often gives rise to an overwhelming sense  of joy, renewal, and rebirth.

**Tryptamines** 

Tryptamines such as psilocybin, LSD, and DMT act primarily as selective agonists at the 5- HT₂A receptor. Unlike MDMA, they do not significantly inhibit presynaptic serotonin or  dopamine transporters (SERT or DAT), resulting in a lower risk of serotonin syndrome and  fewer transporter-mediated drug–drug interactions (Nichols, 2016). Beyond acute receptor  effects, psilocybin has been shown to induce activity-dependent rewiring of large-scale cortical  networks, leading to durable changes in brain connectivity that may underlie sustained  therapeutic effects (Jiang et al., 2026). Emerging evidence further suggests that 5-HT₂A agonists  exert neuroimmune modulatory effects (Thuery, 2025). 

Tryptamines are generally safe from a cardiovascular perspective as well, but can induce  profound psychological phenomena, including ego dissolution, awe, and acute fear. When  supported and integrated appropriately, these experiences often catalyze lasting therapeutic  transformation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018). While caution is warranted in patients with  schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, the incidence of psychedelic-induced psychosis remains lower  than that associated with cannabis (Leweke & Koethe, 2008). Anecdotal reports from  underground practitioners also challenge the notion of absolute contraindication in such  populations, though these cases remain under documented in the literature. 

Reports of “ego dissolution” occur most frequently with the tryptamines. This experience is often  described as a loss of ordinary self-boundaries and a sense of merging with a broader, universal  awareness. Although the term can sound unsettling to those unfamiliar with it, individuals who  undergo such experiences commonly describe a subsequent sense of peace, psychological  renewal, and personal transformation, often likening it to rebirth. Many also report a lasting  reduction, or even complete resolution of the fear of death. A recurring reflection is that the  former sense of self comes to feel diminished or incomplete relative to a more expansive identity  that emerges afterward. Informally, personal conversations with friends or acquaintances  frequently reveal subtle but meaningful differences between those who have had psychedelic  experiences earlier in life and those who have not.

**Ibogaine** 

Ibogaine is pharmacologically distinct from both phenethylamines and tryptamines and presents  greater medical complexity than classical serotonergic psychedelics. Unlike substances such as  psilocybin or LSD, ibogaine and its primary metabolite, noribogaine, have relatively low affinity  for the 5-HT₂A receptor and do not function as high-potency 5-HT₂A agonists. In contrast,  ibogaine exhibits agonist activity at μ-, κ-, and σ-2 opioid receptors and antagonizes  NMDA/glutamate receptors as well as nicotinic acetylcholine (α3β4 nACh) receptors. In  addition, ibogaine exerts broad modulatory effects across multiple neurotransmitter systems,  including serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic pathways (Alper, 2001). This complex, 

   
multi-target pharmacology underlies its diverse therapeutic applications. Ibogaine and  noribogaine have been most extensively studied for their potential roles in the treatment of  substance use disorders (SUD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury  (TBI), and other neuropsychiatric and neurologic conditions. 

***Ibogaine and Substance Use Disorders*** 

One of ibogaine’s most frequently reported therapeutic effects is a marked reduction, and in  many cases elimination, of substance cravings. Mechanistically, this effect is thought to involve  modulation of dopaminergic reward pathways, thereby disrupting conditioned reinforcement and  cue-driven craving (Mash, 2008). Clinically, individuals with opioid, cannabis, kratom, or  alcohol use disorders commonly report partial and often complete relief from craving following  treatment, with this effect sometimes persisting for months. Importantly, a reduction in craving  does not equate to elimination of pharmacologic risk: individuals may be at increased risk of  overdose if prior dosing is resumed after a period of reduced use, and diminished craving for  alcohol does not preclude the ability to consume alcohol. These observations underscore that  ibogaine’s effects on craving do not obviate the need for careful patient education, ongoing  monitoring, and risk-management strategies. 

***Ibogaine and PTSD*** 

Ibogaine’s effects on post-traumatic stress disorder share only limited similarities with those of  classical serotonergic psychedelics. One overlapping feature is the reported capacity to access  deeper aspects of subjective experience and to gain alternative perspectives that allow reframing  of previously triggering events. Traumatic experiences are understood to be encoded not only  cognitively but also in somatic and autonomic patterns. In animals, traumatic activation is often  discharged through spontaneous shaking or trembling, a response thought to prevent the  persistence of trauma (Levine, 1997). In the context of ibogaine treatment, patients commonly  report a distinct internal quivering or tremor, particularly in the core of the body, which may  reflect autonomic discharge of stress-related activation. Others describe this sensation  metaphorically as akin to tuning hundreds of strings, with the body itself serving as the  instrument. 

The psychoactive state induced by ibogaine is highly introspective and is often described by  patients as a lucid, dream-like experience that facilitates autobiographical recall, emotional  processing, and psychological insight. Notably, patients frequently report preservation of ego  structure and a sustained sense of volition throughout the experience. In practical terms,  individuals describe remaining aware of who they are and where they are during the session,  which is often perceived as allowing a more gradual and controlled approach to psychological  exploration. 

***Ibogaine and Traumatic Brain Injury*** 

In an open-label study of 30 veterans with traumatic brain injury treated with ibogaine co administered with magnesium, researchers observed sustained improvements in neuropsychiatric  symptoms and cognitive function, suggesting potential relevance for the treatment of TBI-related 

   
sequelae (Cherian, 2025). A secondary analysis summarizing the *Nature Mental Health* findings  reported that alterations in brain rhythms following ibogaine treatment correlated with  improvements in executive function and reductions in PTSD and anxiety symptoms among  veterans with TBI. Additional summaries have described changes in cortical oscillatory activity,  including increased slower-frequency rhythms such as theta and reduced signal complexity,  findings that were associated with improvements in cognition and emotional regulation. 

***Ibogaine and Neurodegenerative Disorders*** 

Beyond its psychotropic and anti-addictive effects, ibogaine has been shown in preclinical  models to upregulate glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a key mediator of  dopaminergic neuron survival and synaptic plasticity (Marton, 2024). This neurotrophic effect  has prompted interest in ibogaine’s potential relevance to neurodegenerative disorders. Emerging  clinical observations include case reports describing radiologic and clinical improvements, such  as reduced demyelinating lesion burden in patients with multiple sclerosis (Chen, 2025), as well  as sustained improvements in motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms in patients with  Parkinson’s disease (Erny, 2026; Mindscape, 2025). These observations parallel established  evidence demonstrating the role of GDNF in supporting dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in  vivo (Peterson, 2008). 

While molecular and preclinical findings suggest a plausible neurotrophic and neuroprotective  mechanism, it is early clinical observations, rather than mechanistic certainty, that have  prompted further inquiry. In this context, symptomatic improvements are best understood as  clinical signals that may reflect upstream modulation of neurotrophic, neuroplastic, and  neuroprotective systems, warranting further systematic investigation. 

***Ibogaine and Neuropsychiatric Disorders*** 

Ibogaine has also been explored for potential therapeutic relevance in patients with co-occurring  severe mental illness, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (Nunes, 2020), and  schizophrenia. The peer-reviewed literature includes a documented case of ibogaine-associated  psychosis in a patient with schizophrenia, as well as review articles noting potential psychiatric  effects of ibogaine in populations with severe mental illness. These findings underscore the  importance of careful assessment and the exclusion of psychotic disorders in research and  clinical protocols. 

Early observational studies and case series have described reductions in substance use,  improvements in mood regulation, and decreases in depressive symptoms following ibogaine  administration; however, randomized controlled trials remain limited and underpowered, and  definitive efficacy has not been established (Cherian, 2024). 

***Ibogaine in a Family Medicine Practice*** 

In my clinical practice, common patient-reported indications for ibogaine use include depression,  anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, substance use disorders, and  neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. A substantial 

   
subset of patients also presents with a primary intention of psychospiritual exploration. These  individuals describe ibogaine as a tool for examining subjective, symbolic, or existential  dimensions of experience. Such motivations are patient-initiated and reflect personal meaning making rather than medical claims. 

Following ibogaine sessions, some patients have reported subjective changes in cognition,  behavior, and sleep. These reports include a perceived reduction in intrusive or competing  thoughts commonly associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), improved  punctuality, improved sleep quality, and more regular diurnal sleep–wake cycling. Some patients  describe these changes phenomenologically as the emergence of “a space between the trigger  and the reaction,” characterized by a brief temporal delay between a stimulus and their  behavioral or emotional response. Patients report that this delay allows for greater conscious  choice and reduced reactivity. 

These observations are based exclusively on patient self-report, including reports from  individuals I have known for more than 20 years, and have not been independently verified  through objective neurocognitive testing, physiological measurements, or other quantitative  assessment tools. Patients with greater baseline somatic and interoceptive awareness appear more  likely to notice and articulate subtle changes following treatment, a pattern that likely reflects  individual differences in self-awareness rather than measured differences in treatment response. 

***Ibogaine Risk*** 

Ibogaine inhibits various cardiac voltage-gated ion channels including human ether-a-go-go  related gene (hERG) potassium, Nav1.5 sodium, Cav1.2 calcium channels. Ibogaine’s principal  medical risk arises from its ability to block the hERG (KCNH2) potassium channel, a key  determinant of ventricular repolarization. Inhibition of this channel slows potassium efflux  during phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, resulting in QT interval prolongation and an  associated risk of torsades de pointes (TdP). TdP is a polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia  characterized by transient episodes that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. 

Approximately **30 ibogaine-associated deaths** have been reported in the published medical  literature. I have reviewed each of these cases in detail. In the majority, death occurred in the  setting of polypharmacy, concurrent substance use, electrolyte abnormalities, or significant  underlying medical comorbidities. In cases not attributable to overdose or clear alternative  causes, the available evidence most commonly implicates malignant ventricular arrhythmia as  the proximate mechanism of death. Reports of near-fatal events in the literature support  ventricular arrhythmia as the primary pathophysiologic concern associated with ibogaine  exposure, particularly in the setting of QT prolongation (Steinberg & Deyell, 2018; Mestre et al.,  2024). 

The most concerning published case is a report from Puerto Rico (Mestre et al., 2024), in which  a patient without known structural heart disease developed **torsade de pointes following a  reported dose of approximately 2 mg/kg**, with **persistent QT prolongation lasting eight  days**. This duration of QT abnormality is notably longer than that observed in most reported 

   
ibogaine exposures. In my practice, a typical dose of 10-20 mg/kg has usually resulted in QTc  normalization within 24 hours. 

From a pharmacologic perspective, this presentation represents an **extreme outlier** relative to  available dosing and time-course data. An analogy would be observing **torsade de pointes  persisting for a full week after a single low dose of ondansetron**, when thousands of patients  receiving substantially higher cumulative doses demonstrate QT normalization within hours.  Such an event would prompt careful evaluation for idiosyncratic susceptibility, metabolic  impairment, electrolyte disturbance, or unrecognized confounding factors, rather than being  interpreted as representative of typical drug behavior. 

Importantly, the cardiotoxic profile of ibogaine is not uniquely hazardous when compared with  several commonly prescribed medications that also block hERG channels (e.g., methadone,  haloperidol, ondansetron, and macrolides). With appropriate screening, monitoring, and  adherence to established safety parameters, the risks can be responsibly mitigated. (Schwartz,  NEJM, 2025\) 

Standard precautions prior to using ibogaine include assessing for congenital or acquired long  QT syndrome, reviewing medications that may prolong the QT interval, correcting electrolyte  abnormalities, and evaluating for underlying cardiac disease. Although familial screening most  commonly identifies pathogenic variants in the hERG (KCNH2) channel, a range of additional  

potassium and sodium channel gene abnormalities associated with inherited long QT syndromes  may also be detected, as described in the following (Schwartz, NEJM 2025): 

There are at around ten ion channels involved in the cardiac myocyte action potential. Those of  most significance in the ventricular action potential and prolongation of the QT interval are: 

**Current Gene(s) AP Phase Syndrome Key Drugs That Block IKr** KCNH2 (hERG) Phase 3 LQT2 Methadone, sotalol, haloperidol, TCAs,  SSRIs, macrolides, ibogaine 

**IKs** KCNQ1/KCNE1 Phase 3 LQT1 Amiodarone, propofol,  **Ito** KCND3 Phase 1 Brugada    
phenotypes Quinidine 

**IK1** KCNJ2 Phase    
4/late 3 LQT7 Chloroquine, amiodarone 

Three genes account for \~90% of confirmed cases: 

• **KCNQ1 (LQT1)** → ↓ IKs   
• **KCNH2 (LQT2)** → ↓ Ikr   
• **SCN5A (LQT3)** → ↑ late Ina 

Although the prevalence has been estimated at roughly 1 in 2,000, underdiagnosis and reporting  gaps suggest the true prevalence is likely higher (Schwartz 2025).

TdP is more common in those with structural heart diseases, including heart failure, myocardial  infarction and left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as those with congenital LQTS, which may be  concealed. Other risk factors include advanced age, female gender, alcoholic liver disease, recent  conversion from atrial fibrillation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcemia and digoxin  or diuretic therapy. 

Other modifiable factors in prevention of TdP include pharmacokinetics of the different drugs  involved. Examples of potential pharmacokinetic interactions affecting drugs that prolong the  QT interval, inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors, or both:

A 2025 Stanford University study, published in *Nature*, involving 30 Special Operations veterans  receiving ibogaine-magnesium therapy reported significant reductions in PTSD, depression,  suicidality, and addiction severity. While 40% had QTc intervals \> 500 ms, no adverse cardiac  events were observed (Stanford Veterans Psychedelic Initiative, 2025). 

A study by Knuijver et al. (2021) found that 50% of individuals receiving ibogaine therapy  developed QTc intervals exceeding 500 milliseconds, a threshold associated with increased  arrhythmic risk. By comparison, in my own early clinical dataset of more than 50 full-dose  ibogaine sessions conducted under continuous medical supervision and cardiac monitoring, only  

one subject exhibited a QTc \> 500 ms at 24 hours post-administration, and another showed a  transient shortening of the QT interval using intermittent 12 lead ECGs.

   
The use of appropriate equipment is essential when studying the QT interval in patients receiving  ibogaine. In our initial series of 40 patients, continuous cardiac monitors were employed. However, frequent 12-lead ECGs were still required to accurately assess QT interval changes because our monitors at that time did not provide real-time QT interval readings. 

The monitors initially used to determine QT intervals: 

• Our usual office ECG is a **Schiller** device using the Minnesota Code–based analysis combined with Schiller’s proprietary interpretation software called SCHILLER ECG  Interpretation Program (often referred to as ETM – ECG True Interpretation Module).  

On the other hand, 

• Our **Phillips IntelliVue** monitors, which provide real time QT intervals Algorithm uses: Philips bedside monitors (e.g., IntelliVue MX450, MX700, MX800) use the Philips DXL  12-lead ECG Algorithm (developed from earlier Hewlett-Packard algorithms). 

To compare the two:

Continuous, multi-lead cardiac monitoring has yielded QTc measurements that more closely  mirror values reported in the published literature, including a higher observed frequency of QTc  intervals exceeding 500 ms. Relative to intermittent 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs),  continuous telemetry is inherently more sensitive to short-lived fluctuations in ventricular  repolarization because it captures transient changes that may not be present at the specific time a  scheduled ECG is obtained. 

In our observations during ibogaine use, QTc prolongation and repolarization morphology  changes, including T-wave flattening, notching, and Tpeak–Tend prolongation and can fluctuate  over minutes. When QTc was measured simultaneously using a standard 12-lead ECG and a  Philips IntelliVue continuous monitoring system (DXL algorithm), substantial inter-device  differences were observed, with occasional discrepancies reaching up to 400 ms. In some cases,  differences of this magnitude persisted over 24-hour monitoring periods. These discrepancies  remained despite adjustments to lead selection, electrode positioning, and the vector axis used by  the IntelliVue system to derive QT for calculation.

   
Several factors may contribute to this degree of variability. First, signal acquisition differs by  modality: 12-lead ECGs include precordial leads, whereas many bedside monitoring systems  derive signals primarily from limb-lead vectors. Additional variability arises from differences in  automated QT-detection algorithms and in how those algorithms handle abnormal or  low-amplitude T-wave morphology. Heart-rate correction can further amplify divergence. Many  standard ECG systems report QTc using Bazett’s formula (QTcB \= QT/√RR), which is strongly  heart-rate dependent and can introduce systematic error at heart-rate extremes. In contrast,  continuous monitoring systems may apply alternative correction methods (e.g., Fridericia’s  formula, QTcF \= QT/RR^(1/3)) or proprietary adjustments. During the sinus bradycardia  commonly observed with ibogaine, QTc estimates may differ meaningfully depending on the  correction method used, the RR sampling approach, and the degree of moment-to-moment  heart-rate variability captured by continuous monitoring. 

Measurement algorithms also differ in how they define the end of the T wave, particularly when  T waves are flattened, biphasic, or notched. Even small differences in end-of-T placement—on  the order of 1 mm on paper at 25 mm/s—correspond to \~40 ms of QT measurement variance.  When combined with differences in correction formulas and RR sampling, these factors can  generate large QTc discrepancies across devices without necessarily indicating true physiologic  instability. 

Given the known variability of automated QTc assessment, especially in the presence of  repolarization morphology changes, QTc interpretation should be anchored in clinical correlation  and expert review rather than reliance on a single numerical threshold. With continued  prospective monitoring and systematic comparison against published datasets, our objective is to  more precisely characterize the magnitude, temporal pattern, and clinical significance of QTc  changes that should prompt intervention, including thresholds for electrolyte repletion,  magnesium administration, escalation of monitoring, or discontinuation of therapy. 

We have also used the wireless Wearlinq device during ibogaine sessions and observed an even  higher apparent rate of QTc prolongation, with a larger proportion of readings exceeding 500– 600 ms. Wearlinq derives six leads via a patch approximately 6 cm across the precordium, which  may enhance T-wave signal capture in that region. This configuration, together with  device-specific algorithms, likely contributes to the higher apparent frequency and amplitude of  QTc prolongation detected by this system. Its continuous, multi-lead recordings are particularly  valuable for post-session review and for characterizing transient QTc excursions that intermittent  12-lead ECGs are unlikely to capture. 

It is also important to recognize that QT interval measurements can vary by more than 50 ms  even when recordings are taken only minutes apart. Flattened or low-amplitude T waves further  limit accuracy for both automated algorithms and cardiologist over-reads, reinforcing the need  for cautious clinical judgment. From a manual measurement standpoint, the difference between a  QT interval of 480 ms (often treated as an upper-range value) and 520 ms (a range associated  with increased concern) is only one small box (1 mm) at 25 mm/s. Discriminating within this  narrow margin is challenging even for experienced clinicians, underscoring the practical limits of  manual QT measurement precision.

   
Finally, lead configuration can materially influence QT assessment. On a standard 12-lead ECG,  QT is often measured in anterior precordial leads (V1–V6), where T waves are typically most  clearly defined. In contrast, many bedside monitoring systems primarily record limb leads (I, II,  and III) derived from a limited electrode set. Importantly, precordial leads—especially V1–V4— are among the most dynamic regions for T-wave morphology and commonly exhibit flattening,  notching, or biphasic patterns. These features increase measurement variability and can  contribute to discrepancies across monitoring modalities. 

In our full-dose ibogaine sessions, the following ECG changes have been consistently observed: 

1\. Sinus bradycardia   
2\. QTc prolongation   
3\. Flattened T waves   
4\. Notched T waves   
5\. Prolonged Tpeak–Tend interval 

By 24 hours, the majority of patients with these morphologic changes and QT intervals have  returned to normal ranges, although some may exhibit persistent T-wave flattening for an  additional 12 hours. I hope to continue mapping these changes over longer time frames as part of  my ongoing personal research. 

Early observations supported by existing medical literature and thousands of sessions conducted  legally in other countries indicate that a screening ECG, basic laboratory testing, comprehensive  medication review, and thorough history and physical examination provide adequate screening to  ensure a safe ibogaine session. Prospective studies will be required to confirm these findings. 

It is also noteworthy that numerous underground ibogaine providers operate in North America. I  have personally interviewed and worked alongside with six such practitioners in Canada and the  United States. Many report having treated several hundred participants each, most using  traditional Bwiti methods with raw iboga bark or total extract, and all performing at least a  baseline ECG prior to administration. None of these practitioners have reported serious  complications or fatalities among their participants. 

By contrast, there is limited publicly available information regarding the reported death of an  American tourist at a retreat center in Costa Rica in 2024\. The available reports are sparse and do  not provide sufficient detail to clearly characterize the clinical circumstances or contributing  factors surrounding the event. 

To mitigate potential risks, I obtain ibogaine from a licensed pharmacist in Texas. For additional  verification, I have utilized King County Public Health’s Robert Clewis Center, where samples  are analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), followed by confirmatory  gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) at a reference laboratory. In the past, I have  also coordinated independent mass spectrometry testing through patients with scientific  expertise.

   
My pre-screening protocol includes a resting ECG for all patients and, when clinically indicated,  a treadmill stress test to help identify latent or familial long QT syndromes. Any electrolyte  abnormalities are corrected in advance, and intravenous magnesium is routinely administered as  part of the monitoring protocol. 

Genetic testing for cytochrome P450 isoform activity has not yet proven clinically useful for  safety screening, though it may have future value in predicting variables such as treatment  intensity or duration of the clinical course. 

My clinical background includes experience in ECG interpretation and treadmill stress testing,  skills I developed while also serving as a compensated physician for cardiac diagnostics at  Providence Hospital in Seattle during the 1980s under the supervision of the director, James  Clifton, MD. Earlier, during my residency in the 1970s—before “Do Not Resuscitate” orders  became standard practice, I gained substantial experience in emergency resuscitation, routinely  managing cardiac arrests, performing endotracheal intubations, and placing central lines as part  of daily duties. 

In addition to my clinical work, I have studied with shamans of the Bwiti tradition, from which  the ceremonial use of iboga originates. Some of these practitioners have also participated in  sessions I facilitated in my clinic to experience purified ibogaine HCl, as their traditional practice  typically involves the use of raw iboga bark.I have also trained and collaborated with other  therapists and practitioners who are experienced in the ceremonial and therapeutic use of other  psychedelics. 

***Microdosing Ibogaine*** 

Microdosed ibogaine appears to have meaningful therapeutic potential, although the current body  of peer-reviewed evidence remains limited. Early reports suggest possible benefit in bipolar spectrum conditions (Fernandes-Nascimento MH). In my clinical practice, several patients with  long-standing insomnia have reported dramatic improvement with microdoses in the range of 4– 18 mg. Others have described reductions in anxiety, depressed mood, and emotional reactivity to  previously triggering situations. 

In addition, early clinical observations from my practice, along with non–peer-reviewed reports,  suggest that sub-psychedelic “mini-doses” of ibogaine (approximately 150–300 mg) may lead to  noticeable improvement in Parkinson’s disease symptoms within days of initiating treatment  (Ermy, 2026), (Mindscape, 2023). A related dosing approach has also been described in a  successful case report involving methadone detoxification using repeated low doses of ibogaine  (Wilkins, 2016). 

As with all therapeutic interventions, patient responses are heterogeneous, and not all individuals  derive benefit. Any trial use of ibogaine should therefore be time-limited and carefully  monitored. Recommended safeguards include informed consent; baseline and follow-up ECGs  with QT/QTc assessment; electrolyte monitoring; and thorough medication review to identify  QT-prolonging agents or CYP-mediated drug interactions. Clear stop criteria and appropriate  integration support are also advised.

**Integration** 

One of ibogaine’s most profound effects is the ability to witness one’s life story with clarity and  without judgment. For many individuals, the experience is more psycho-spiritual than  pharmacologic. While ibogaine is particularly effective in reducing or eliminating physical  cravings associated with addiction, its long-term benefits are significantly enhanced when the  experience is followed by structured integration involving family, community, and therapeutic  support. 

This principle holds across all psychedelic therapies: integration is essential for translating acute  experiences into lasting change. Although a single session may initiate a neurobiological “reset”  and interrupt maladaptive patterns, sustained recovery and personal growth depend on consistent  relational and behavioral reinforcement. Ongoing therapy, family involvement, and a supportive  community are critical components in ensuring meaningful and durable outcomes. 

**The Spiritual Dimension** 

Therapeutic outcomes are often correlated with **Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ)** scores, which measure the depth of mystical or transcendent states. In clinical and experiential  settings, individuals—particularly religious scholars—frequently describe a renewed  understanding of their spiritual traditions following psychedelic sessions. Across many faiths,  spontaneous experiences akin to **satori**, **samadhi**, **bodhi**, **epiphany, or noetic insights** have 

   
been reported. While such states are not exclusive to psychedelics, they are often catalyzed  within the psychedelic context. 

In a landmark study conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and New York  University, high-dose psilocybin was administered to 24 religious leaders representing Christian,  Jewish, Buddhist, and Muslim traditions. Remarkably, **96%** of participants described the  experience as one of the five most spiritually significant moments of their lives. Many reported  profound encounters with a divine presence, a deepening of their faith and vocation, and a  greater sense of unity and interreligious understanding. (Griffiths et al, 2019\)

**Integration and Psychospiritual Healing** 

The result of a psychospiritual journey, whether initiated through psychedelics, breathwork,  meditation, psychotherapy, or even spontaneous experiences such as a near-death event, often  transforms the way an individual perceives their life. These experiences have the potential to  dissolve long-held narratives of limitation or suffering, allowing for a broader, more integrated  understanding of the self. What was once viewed as broken or pathological is often  recontextualized as a meaningful part of the human story. 

At the boundaries of the conventional diagnosis-and-treatment model lie conditions such as  compulsions, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, insomnia, fear of death, alcoholism, opiate addiction,  and chronic low self-esteem. Though diverse in their presentation, these patterns most often stem  from unresolved trauma and early adverse experiences that fragment the sense of self. Here, we  examine the emotional roots of disease. Psychedelics, when used skillfully and within a  supportive therapeutic framework, can help individuals access and integrate these underlying  wounds. Rather than rejecting or suppressing painful memories, the individual learns to accept  them as integral aspects of their lived experience, transforming trauma into a source of insight  and strength. 

Integration is the process through which these experiences are woven back into daily life,  transforming moments of revelation into enduring change. By embracing all aspects of life, both  joyful and painful, creative and destructive, one begins to recover a sense of wholeness. This  expanded awareness nurtures compassion, authenticity, and resilience, qualities that form the  foundation of sustained healing. From a platform of therapy and self-examination, the use of  psychedelics allow for a piercing of the veil, in further exploration of ones own nature. 

Many of my midlife patients have grieved the loss of the activities that once defined their sense  of vitality—playing basketball, skiing, or engaging in sex with youthful energy. I remind them 

   
that real vitality and happiness are not rooted primarily in physical capability. It comes from the  ability to inhabit the present moment, to live authentically and without apology, and to cultivate  meaningful connections that nourish the soul. 

When one lives from this place of alignment, life itself becomes richer and more fulfilling. The  later years, often seen as a period of decline, becomes instead a time of deep integration and  renewal, a return to the essence of one’s being and a realization of true holistic healing. Freed  from the compulsions of ego and performance, one discovers that what once felt like loss is, in  truth, an expansion into greater wholeness, presence, and peace. In this sense, these truly become  the best years of your life. 

The psychedelic experience, particularly when the ego remains intact or becomes reengaged  during the return from the altered state, is simultaneously personal and universal. It can facilitate  reconnection with a deeper sense of self that exists beneath habitual personality structures and  conditioned patterns of behavior. In accessing this underlying core, individuals may rediscover  aspects of their own essential nature and also recognizing that this same fundamental humanity is  shared by others. Hence, healing of their community is realized. 

**Professional Collaboration and Practice Context** 

Over the past two years, I have hosted monthly meetings in my home with licensed therapists  and physicians to discuss clinical experiences and share knowledge related to psychedelic assisted therapy. I have also participated in two additional case-review groups focused on  psychedelic medicine and have stayed in regular contact with physicians who used MDMA  therapeutically in the 1980s, prior to its reclassification. Their historical insight has helped  inform my clinical approach. 

I have met with medical directors and providers from major ibogaine clinics in Mexico, as well  as one in Bolivia, to discuss treatment protocols and safety standards. Through these  relationships, I may be invited to assist in establishing ibogaine treatment sessions in Florida. I  am also in the early planning stages of developing an ibogaine laboratory for Jim Grimsby, PhD,  a neuroscientist and the head of psychedelic research at the Neuroscience Institute at the  University of Colorado, Denver. Given Colorado’s more progressive regulatory stance toward  psychedelic medicine, I intend to apply for medical licensure there to continue expanding this  work. 

At present, I travel to Texas on a monthly basis to participate in the provision of these services  within a church-affiliated setting in which the substances are treated as sacraments. All  participants are managed using standardized clinical protocols and receive appropriate medical  monitoring throughout. In Washington, options are being evaluated for a comparable  ecclesiastical framework to contextualize the sacramental use of ibogaine, with the goal of  maintaining alignment with applicable legal and regulatory standards. 

**Conclusion**

   
Psychedelic-assisted therapy presents both potential therapeutic benefits and recognized medical  and psychological risks. With careful patient selection, medical oversight, and structured  integration support, these treatments can be administered in a manner that prioritizes safety and  professional responsibility. As clinical research continues to expand, there is increasing  recognition of a potential role for physician involvement in the development and oversight of  psychedelic care protocols. Based on my experience conducting over 600 video documented sessions, I believe I can offer valuable clinical insights that may inform ongoing academic and  regulatory efforts to evaluate the role of psychedelic therapies within evidence-based medical  practice.

**Author’s Note:** 

The **phenethylamines,** particularly MDMA, can help open a pathway back to one’s essence. By  “essence,” I mean the self we are born with—the part that inspires a mother’s love the moment  she first holds her child, and the part naturally shared with other children in play. This essence is  often most deeply known by our family and childhood companions. 

As life unfolds, we take on rules, schooling, jobs, cars, and houses. These are the domain of the  ego, the structure that allows us to meet responsibilities and navigate the world. While the ego is  necessary, over time we tend to identify primarily with it, leaving our essence less visible in  daily life. 

In therapeutic sessions, reconnecting with essence often feels like remembering something  familiar rather than discovering something new. Afterward, ordinary every-day consciousness is  infused with a wider perspective—one that reaches beyond personal suffering to encompass a  sense of shared humanity. With this expanded view, challenges like anxiety, relationship  struggles, or emotional pain can be met with greater clarity and healing potential. 

This journey often unfolds as encounters with younger parts of ourselves. Each meeting feels  like a joyful reunion, even when past trauma surfaces. From here, the mature ego can step  forward as a caretaker, offering protection and compassion to these more vulnerable selves. For  some, the journey may extend all the way back to birth or even conception; for others, it may  involve ancestral exploration, where inherited patterns are brought into harmony with individual  purpose. 

To support this inner process, I offer a few guidelines. Keep conversation to a minimum, as  using words tend to pull attention outward. I often suggest the use of an image of a river:  Imagine yourself in a boat drifting downstream toward your essence—toward your intuition and  deeper knowing. Stay connected to the flow by anchoring attention on body sensations and the  music in your headphones. 

Along the way, you may notice familiar figures—family members, mentors, friends, partners,  even children, appearing on the banks, inviting you to engage. Acknowledge them gently and  promise to return later, while continuing downstream. If inner imagery such as a door or a cave  appears, allow yourself to enter and follow what arises. In about an hour or so you will know  when you meet your essence, and then you can turn around and greet those people. 

There are clearly many other approaches in MDMA therapy. Among the most popular is Internal  Family Systems (IFS) where a trained therapist uses different parts of one’s self and  acknowledges our essential nature of calm, clarity, compassion, and connectedness. Yet others 

   
involve more somatic perspective, involving the physical body as a source of wisdom and  memory to access 

**Tryptamines** often open the door to an expanded, transpersonal, or “cosmic” perspective,  frequently accompanied by a profound dissolution of the ego. For individuals who rely heavily  on control, this loss of self-boundaries can initially provoke anxiety or fear. This highlights the  clinical importance of careful attention to set and setting: preparing the patient psychologically,  creating a supportive therapeutic environment, and maintaining a strong sense of safety and  containment. 

From this vantage point, the cosmic perspective offers a deeper understanding of how the self  relates to the larger world. In this realm, many encounter experiences of “death” — not as an  end, but as a transformative passage — through which the fear of death itself is often diminished  or released. 

**Ibogaine** possesses a unique therapeutic profile among psychedelic compounds. Its effects are  often described as a “life review”—a sequence of vivid, autobiographical visions unfolding in a  coherent, narrative-like manner. Unlike MDMA and other agents, ibogaine typically preserves  ego integrity, allowing individuals to observe and reflect on their experiences from a stable and  continuous sense of self. In many cases, there appears to be an element of volition; participants  may even choose which periods or themes of their life to revisit, or, even choose to defer to  another time. There is no loss of identity or forgetting of self during the session, therefore there  is not the fear that the ego experiences that usually inhibits self-examination.
