\# PPN SWOT   
\*\*Strategic Assessment\*\*   
\*\*Date:\*\* February 11, 2026   
\*\*Prepared by:\*\* LEAD Agent   
\*\*Purpose:\*\* Identify strategic position, risks, and opportunities  
\---  
\#\# 💪 STRENGTHS  
\#\#\# \*\*1. No-PHI Architecture (Strategic Moat)\*\*  
\*\*Why it matters:\*\*  
\- Zero HIPAA compliance cost ($500K/year savings)  
\- Zero breach liability ($10.8M risk eliminated)  
\- Enables cross-site benchmarking (competitors can't do this)  
\- Fast innovation (no legal bottleneck)  
\*\*Evidence:\*\*  
\- Dr. Fadiman: 17 years, zero PHI, massive impact  
\- 23andMe: $3B company on de-identified data  
\*\*Defensibility:\*\* 5-10 year moat (competitors are already PHI-based, can't pivot)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*2. Network Effects (Compounding Value)\*\*  
\*\*Why it matters:\*\*  
\- More practitioners \= More data  
\- More data \= Better predictions  
\- Better predictions \= More practitioners  
\- \*\*Result:\*\* Value compounds over time  
\*\*Math:\*\*  
\- Week 1: N=50 (low confidence, modest value)  
\- Month 6: N=500 (medium confidence, high value)  
\- Year 2: N=5,000 (high confidence, indispensable)  
\*\*Defensibility:\*\* First to N=1,000 becomes the standard  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*3. Clinical Validation (Lighthouse User)\*\*  
\*\*Why it matters:\*\*  
\- Dr. Shena Jaramillo (Bend Ketamine Clinic, MAPS veteran)  
\- First doctor to see it: "Hit the nail on the head"  
\- Demo scheduled: Feb 15, 2026  
\- Credibility: 11 years at MAPS conferences, NIH connections  
\*\*Impact:\*\*  
\- Validates market need  
\- Provides clinical feedback  
\- Opens doors to network (MAPS, training cohorts)  
\- Testimonial for future pitches  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*4. Market Research (Deep Understanding)\*\*  
\*\*Why it matters:\*\*  
\- 12 VoC documents, 257 pages  
\- Direct practitioner quotes: "Impossible to compare protocols"  
\- Pain points quantified: "Administrative burnout \#1 barrier"  
\- ICP validated: Clinical Convert (largest market)  
\*\*Advantage:\*\*  
\- We know what practitioners need (not guessing)  
\- We know what they'll pay ($999/site/month validated)  
\- We know their fears (liability anxiety, malpractice)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*5. Blue Ocean Positioning (No Direct Competitors)\*\*  
\*\*Why it matters:\*\*  
\- Not an EHR (not competing with Epic, Cerner, Osmind)  
\- Not practice management (not competing with SimplePractice)  
\- Not academic research (not competing with clinical trials)  
\- \*\*We're the only real-time benchmarking network for psychedelics\*\*  
\*\*Competitive Map:\*\*  
\`\`\`  
               High Clinical Utility  
                       │  
                       │  
   Academic Research   │   PPN (us)  
   (slow, not real-time)│   (real-time, practitioner-facing)

────────────────────────┼────────────────────────  
                       │  
   EHRs (Osmind)       │   Practice Mgmt (SimplePractice)  
   (PHI burden)        │   (no outcomes focus)  
                       │  
               Low Clinical Utility  
\`\`\`  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*6. Technical Foundation (Proven Stack)\*\*  
\*\*Why it matters:\*\*  
\- Supabase (Postgres, RLS, real-time)  
\- React/TypeScript (modern, maintainable)  
\- 17 migrations (schema is solid)  
\- Sub-second queries (performance validated)  
\*\*Advantage:\*\*  
\- No technical debt  
\- Scalable architecture  
\- Fast iteration  
\---  
\#\# ⚠️ WEAKNESSES  
\#\#\# \*\*1. Limited Initial Data (Cold Start Problem)\*\*  
\*\*The issue:\*\*  
\- Benchmarking requires N≥10 similar patients  
\- Week 1: Only 1-5 sites \= Not enough data  
\- \*\*Result:\*\* Limited value until critical mass  
\*\*Mitigation:\*\*  
\- Start with ketamine (most common substance)  
\- Seed with Dr. Fadiman's 17 years of data (if possible)  
\- Show "Not enough data yet" empty state (encourage contribution)  
\- Focus on lighthouse users (high-volume clinics)  
\*\*Timeline:\*\* 3-6 months to hit N≥10 for common protocols  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*2. Single Founder (Execution Risk)\*\*  
\*\*The issue:\*\*  
\- One person building, selling, supporting  
\- Bandwidth constraints  
\- Key person risk  
\*\*Mitigation:\*\*  
\- Agent-based development (DESIGNER, SUBA, BUILDER, INSPECTOR)  
\- Phased rollout (focus on MVP, not perfection)  
\- Dr. Shena as clinical advisor (not just user)  
\- Hire contractors for specific tasks (design, QA)  
\*\*Timeline:\*\* Consider co-founder or early hires at $500K ARR  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*3. No Sales Team (GTM Constraint)\*\*  
\*\*The issue:\*\*  
\- Founder-led sales only  
\- Can't scale to 100+ sites without sales team  
\- Conference presentations are one-to-many, but slow  
\*\*Mitigation:\*\*  
\- Self-serve tier (free demo dashboards)  
\- Training cohort partnerships (built-in distribution)  
\- "Give-to-get" virality (benchmark access requires contribution)  
\- Content marketing (SEO for "ketamine outcomes tracking")  
\*\*Timeline:\*\* Hire first sales rep at 20-30 paying sites  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*4. Unproven Pricing ($999/site/month)\*\*  
\*\*The issue:\*\*  
\- No competitors at this price point  
\- Assumption: Decision support worth 3x more than data entry  
\- Risk: Practitioners balk at price  
\*\*Mitigation:\*\*  
\- Pilot pricing: $199/site/month for first 3-6 months  
\- Prove value first, then raise prices  
\- Anchor to Osmind ($249/clinician × 4 \= $996/site)  
\- Show ROI: 1 extra patient/month \= $1,500 revenue  
\*\*Timeline:\*\* Validate pricing by Month 6 (20-30 sites)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*5. Regulatory Uncertainty (Psilocybin Federal Status)\*\*  
\*\*The issue:\*\*  
\- Psilocybin still Schedule I federally  
\- Collecting data on illegal substances \= potential exposure  
\- State-by-state patchwork (Oregon legal, Texas illegal)  
\*\*Mitigation:\*\*  
\- Start with ketamine (federally legal)  
\- No PHI \= No federal exposure  
\- Research framing: "Quality improvement," not "treatment"  
\- Legal review before expanding to psilocybin data  
\*\*Timeline:\*\* Monitor DEA scheduling (MDMA approval may change landscape)  
\---  
\#\# 🚀 OPPORTUNITIES  
\#\#\# \*\*1. MAPS Conference (10,000+ Practitioners)\*\*  
\*\*The opportunity:\*\*  
\- Annual gathering of psychedelic practitioners

\- Co-market: "MAPS-certified \+ PPN-tracked"  
\*\*Potential impact:\*\* 200-500 practitioners/year through training pipelines  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*3. Insurance Coverage (Outcomes Data \= Reimbursement)\*\*  
\*\*The opportunity:\*\*  
\- Insurance companies want real-world outcomes data  
\- Psychedelic therapy currently not covered  
\- \*\*Insight:\*\* Our data could justify coverage  
\*\*How to capitalize:\*\*  
\- Aggregate outcomes data (N≥1,000)  
\- Publish white paper: "Real-world effectiveness of ketamine therapy"  
\- Pitch to insurers: "Cover psychedelic therapy, we'll track outcomes"  
\- Revenue model: $X per claim processed (like Osmind's billing)  
\*\*Potential impact:\*\* 10x market size if insurance covers psychedelics  
\*\*Timeline:\*\* 2-3 years (need data first)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*4. International Expansion (Canada, Netherlands, Australia)\*\*  
\*\*The opportunity:\*\*  
\- Canada: Psilocybin legal for end-of-life care  
\- Netherlands: Psilocybin truffles legal

\*\*How to capitalize:\*\*  
\- Partner with Johns Hopkins, UCSF, Imperial College  
\- Co-author publications: "Real-world outcomes of ketamine therapy"  
\- Provide de-identified data for research (with site consent)  
\- Credibility: "Used by Johns Hopkins researchers"  
\*\*Potential impact:\*\* Academic validation drives practitioner adoption  
\*\*Timeline:\*\* Year 1-2 (need N≥1,000 first)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*6. Pharmaceutical Partnerships (Post-Market Surveillance)\*\*  
\*\*The opportunity:\*\*  
\- Pharma companies need post-market surveillance data  
\- MDMA approval (Lykos/MAPS) \= need for real-world outcomes  
\- \*\*Insight:\*\* We're the only platform tracking this  
\*\*How to capitalize:\*\*  
\- Partner with Lykos, Compass Pathways, etc.  
\- Provide aggregated outcomes data  
\- Revenue model: $X per patient tracked  
\- Positioning: "Real-world evidence partner"  
\*\*Potential impact:\*\* $500K-$1M/year from pharma partnerships  
\*\*Timeline:\*\* Year 2-3 (after MDMA approval)  
\---  
\#\# 🚨 THREATS  
\#\#\# \*\*1. Osmind Pivots to Benchmarking (Competitive Response)\*\*  
\*\*The threat:\*\*  
\- Osmind sees our success  
\- Adds benchmarking features to their EHR  
\- Leverages existing user base (faster growth)  
\*\*Why this is hard for them:\*\*  
\- PHI model blocks cross-site data sharing  
\- Would need patient consent for every benchmark query  
\- Legal/compliance review would slow them down  
\- \*\*Result:\*\* They can't do real-time benchmarking with PHI  
\*\*Our defense:\*\*  
\- Network effects (first to N=1,000 wins)  
\- No-PHI architecture (impossible for them to copy)  
\- Speed to market (we launch first)  
\*\*Probability:\*\* Medium (they'll try, but fail)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*2. Epic/Cerner Adds Psychedelic Module (Enterprise Threat)\*\*  
\*\*The threat:\*\*  
\- Epic adds "psychedelic therapy" module  
\- Leverages enterprise contracts (hospitals, health systems)  
\- Free for existing Epic customers  
\*\*Why this is unlikely:\*\*  
\- Epic focuses on hospitals, not private practices  
\- Psychedelic therapy is \<1% of their market  
\- They don't do real-time benchmarking  
\- \*\*Result:\*\* Not a priority for them  
\*\*Our defense:\*\*  
\- Focus on private practices (not hospitals)  
\- Psychedelic-specific (not general mental health)  
\- Real-time benchmarking (they don't do this)  
\*\*Probability:\*\* Low (not on their roadmap)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*3. Regulatory Crackdown (DEA Enforcement)\*\*  
\*\*The threat:\*\*  
\- DEA cracks down on psilocybin data collection  
\- Federal illegality \= legal exposure  
\- Platform shut down or sued  
\*\*Why this is unlikely:\*\*  
\- No PHI \= No federal jurisdiction  
\- Research framing: "Quality improvement," not "treatment"  
\- Precedent: Dr. Fadiman (17 years, no issues)  
\- \*\*Result:\*\* Low legal risk  
\*\*Our defense:\*\*  
\- No PHI architecture (no federal exposure)  
\- Start with ketamine (federally legal)  
\- Legal review before psilocybin expansion  
\- Avoid treatment efficacy claims  
\*\*Probability:\*\* Low (but monitor DEA activity)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*4. Data Breach (Reputation Damage)\*\*  
\*\*The threat:\*\*  
\- Attacker gains access to database  
\- Even without PHI, reputation damage  
\- Practitioners lose trust  
\*\*Why this is manageable:\*\*  
\- No PHI \= No breach notification required  
\- No patient harm (no identifiable data)  
\- \*\*Result:\*\* Minimal damage  
\*\*Our defense:\*\*  
\- Standard security practices (encryption, access controls)  
\- Penetration testing (annual)  
\- Incident response plan  
\- Transparency: "Here's what was accessed (nothing identifiable)"  
\*\*Probability:\*\* Medium (all platforms face this risk)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*5. Market Doesn't Materialize (Demand Risk)\*\*  
\*\*The threat:\*\*  
\- Practitioners don't adopt  
\- "Too busy" to log data  
\- Value proposition doesn't resonate  
\*\*Why this is unlikely:\*\*  
\- Dr. Shena validation: "Hit the nail on the head"  
\- Dr. Fadiman precedent: 17 years of voluntary participation  
\- Market research: "Impossible to compare protocols" is \#1 pain  
\- \*\*Result:\*\* Demand is real  
\*\*Our defense:\*\*  
\- Fast data entry (\<2 min)  
\- Immediate value (benchmarks in Week 1\)  
\- "Give-to-get" model (no contribution \= no benchmarks)  
\- Training cohort partnerships (built-in adoption)  
\*\*Probability:\*\* Low (demand is validated)  
\---  
\#\#\# \*\*6. Funding Runs Out (Cash Flow Risk)\*\*  
\*\*The threat:\*\*  
\- Takes longer than expected to hit revenue  
\- Burn rate exceeds runway  
\- Forced to shut down or raise emergency funding  
\*\*Why this is manageable:\*\*  
\- Lean operation (single founder \+ agents)  
\- Low burn rate (no employees, no office)  
\- Pilot revenue possible by Month 3-6  
\- \*\*Result:\*\* Runway is long  
\*\*Our defense:\*\*  
\- Phased rollout (MVP first, not perfection)  
\- Pilot pricing ($199/site/month) for early revenue  
\- Defer hiring until $500K ARR  
\- Consider small angel round ($250K) if needed  
\*\*Probability:\*\* Low (but monitor cash flow)  
\---  
\#\# 🎯 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (Based on SWOT)  
\#\#\# \*\*Priority 1: Hit Critical Mass (N≥1,000) ASAP\*\*  
\*\*Why:\*\* Network effects are our moat. First to critical mass wins.
