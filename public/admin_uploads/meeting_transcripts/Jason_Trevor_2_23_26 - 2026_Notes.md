Meeting records [Transcript](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02) File 

### **Summary**

Jason and Trevor discussed recent system updates, including workflow features and resolved an access issue so Jason could upload documents to the shared folder. A significant portion of the meeting focused on defining the project's scope, with Jason stressing the need for clear documentation that identifies the tool as a "post-screening treatment and follow-up logging tool" focused on regulatory compliance, not a full EHS system, while Trevor confirmed the database architecture is designed to prevent PHI collection. They agreed that the immediate next step is for Jason to schedule a demo of the developed tool with Dr. Allen to gather feedback, and Trevor provided a walkthrough of the new, streamlined workflow, which includes features for capturing informed consent, logging timestamped vitals, and a patient-facing experience screen.

### **Details**

* **Recent System Checks and Workflow Features**: Trevor informed Jason that they ran another series of system checks and integrated workflow features to ensure that anyone picking up the project can easily understand the status, as previously discussed ([00:02:20](#heading=h.tfqkrfy9z14u)).

* **Need for Scope Alignment and Documentation**: Jason expressed a need for clearer documentation of the project's scope, identifying what the tool is and is not, to improve their understanding ([00:02:20](#heading=h.tfqkrfy9z14u)). They suggested documenting exclusions, such as the tool not being an EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) system, and focusing on a core set of 5 to 10 key features ([00:03:08](#00:03:08)).

* **Document Access Issues and Resolution**: Jason mentioned they could not upload a document to the shared link because they lacked access, which Trevor quickly resolved by changing the default permission from "commenter" to "editor" ([00:03:08](#00:03:08)). Trevor directed Jason to upload the document to the "Jason update Monday 223" file with five tabs ([00:04:05](#heading=h.ytwnplei99im)).

* **Document Sharing and Loading Delay**: Jason experienced difficulty uploading their document to the Google platform and ultimately decided to share their screen to review their initial notes first, postponing the document upload ([00:04:55](#heading=h.rdyeczbrdohh)).

* **Prioritizing Meeting with Dr. Allen**: Jason initiated a discussion on the order of next steps, suggesting they should meet with Dr. Allen, who has provided information but has not yet seen the developed tool. Trevor agreed that they are ready to show the tool to Dr. Allen, and Jason committed to scheduling this meeting ([00:05:32](#00:05:32)).

* **Defining In-Scope and Out-of-Scope Functionality**: Jason explained their methodology for scope definition, which involves creating a tracker to clarify what functionality is included and what needs to be placed on the back burner ([00:06:20](#00:06:20)). Their initial high-level scope list included identifying what the tool is not, specifically noting it is not an EHS system or a pre-screening tool ([00:06:56](#00:06:56)).

* **Clarification on EHS System Differences**: Trevor clarified that a typical EHS system handles treatment, billing, insurance, and scheduling, whereas their tool is a stripped-down version focused only on treatment compliance tracking. The tool is designed to allow practitioners to document compliance while maintaining patient and practitioner privacy, avoiding the complexities of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance tied to a full EHS system ([00:07:28](#00:07:28)).

* **Tool Positioning as Post-Screening/Treatment Log**: Jason summarized the tool's current function as a "post-screening treatment and follow-up logging tool". Trevor noted that while the starting point is post-treatment decision, they included some pre-screening features, such as the MEQ30, as previously requested ([00:08:23](#00:08:23)).

* **Emphasis on Regulatory Compliance and Networking**: Jason stressed that the tool's core focus is regulatory compliance and building a network of people for interaction and sharing, in addition to treatment logging. Key in-scope features include profiles and a function to pull up information about other practitioners who have managed similar contraindications or safety issues ([00:09:08](#00:09:08)).

* **Protecting Privacy and Avoiding PHI Collection**: Trevor confirmed that the tool excludes billing and the collection of personally identifying information (PII) to maintain regulatory compliance and protect privacy ([00:09:56](#00:09:56)). Trevor mentioned a document called "Why No PHI" that details this approach ([00:10:43](#00:10:43)).

* **Legal and Cost Constraints on Networking Integration**: Trevor explained that integrating social networking directly with the database would introduce HIPAA compliance issues, requiring approximately $4 million for legal fees and registration ([00:12:11](#00:12:11)). They proposed two solutions for the social networking component: using prepackaged messages or creating a separate, seamless social platform on a different domain (ppnportal.com or .org) ([00:13:02](#00:13:02)).

* **Architectural Solidity and Compliance of Database**: Trevor stated that the database architecture is designed to make it impossible to collect Personal Health Information (PHI) today or in the future, ensuring it is defensible in court, compliant for insurance, and HIPAA compliant ([00:13:57](#00:13:57)).

* **Network Functionality and Safety Triggers**: Jason sought clarification on how networking would function when a safety issue, like a conflict or a trigger, arises during a session ([00:14:54](#00:14:54)). They proposed functionality to quickly view and contact other medical professionals who have experience with those specific triggers ([00:15:43](#00:15:43)).

* **Proposed Workaround for Networking Links**: Trevor suggested that a link could pop up when a warning is triggered, which would direct the user outside the database to access shared provider information if the providers consented to sharing it ([00:15:43](#00:15:43)). They cautioned against providing medical advice on the site, as this would require a different, more expensive business model ([00:16:45](#00:16:45)).

* **Alignment on Next Steps: Tool Walkthrough and Dr. Allen Feedback**: Trevor suggested doing a walkthrough of the system, which they believe will answer many of Jason's questions, followed by a discussion of any remaining issues ([00:17:32](#00:17:32)). The primary immediate goal is to obtain feedback from Dr. Allen to prevent unnecessary rework before advancing development ([00:18:10](#00:18:10)).

* **Confirmation of Walkthrough Order and Efficiency**: After a minor misunderstanding about the timing of the Dr. Allen meeting, Trevor clarified that they still want to address Jason's questions but prefer to do so while demonstrating the system for efficiency ([00:19:05](#00:19:05)).

* **Use Case and Tool Intersection in Therapist Process**: Jason asked where Trevor envisions the tool intersecting the therapist's process, post-pre-screen. Trevor confirmed the tool's design focuses on the core treatment tracking, starting from when the patient enters the office and ending when they leave, as defined by Dr. Allen ([00:21:20](#00:21:20)).

* **Tool's Purpose for Tracking and Legal Defensibility**: Trevor reiterated that the tool's function is to give practitioners the ability to track treatment and report on it without violating privacy, supporting them in billing insurance or, in Bridger's case, proving compliance in court ([00:22:20](#00:22:20)).

* **Need for Protocol Templating Functionality**: Jason proposed adding a function to create a template from an existing, successful protocol, enabling practitioners to easily copy baseline data like dosing and treatment focus (e.g., PTSD) to save preparation time ([00:24:13](#00:24:13)) ([00:26:06](#00:26:06)).

* **Protocol Viewing and Data Set Availability**: Trevor confirmed that while the functionality is not yet live, users will be able to look up, view, and print protocols, including the entire data set and statistics, filtered by various factors, but without personally identifiable information ([00:27:44](#00:27:44)).

* **Scheduling Demonstration with Dr. Allen**: Jason agreed the tool is ready for review and will schedule a walkthrough/demo session with Dr. Allen by the end of the week to gather preliminary feedback ([00:29:03](#00:29:03)).

* **Verification of Placeholder Data and Statistics**: Jason flagged discrepancies in practitioner numbers (e.g., 15,000) found on the start page. Trevor confirmed these were dummy data, likely generated by an AI, and stressed a principle of absolute transparency and verified factual representation, with a plan to add citations for statistics ([00:29:41](#00:29:41)).

* **Removal of Unnecessary Features**: Trevor confirmed they removed the state page that Sarah found unnecessary. Jason acknowledged that most of their remaining questions related to features and order are secondary until the new system is viewed ([00:31:13](#00:31:13)).

* **Potency Normalizer and Feature Backlogging**: Jason inquired about the potency normalizer feature, which Trevor confirmed is on the back burner, along with Apple Watch integration and other potential features, which were either removed or hidden for the initial Dr. Allen review ([00:31:51](#00:31:51)).

* **Strategic Importance of Potency Normalization and Sourcing**: Jason emphasized the huge opportunity the potency normalizer presents for establishing standardized substances, generating potential income streams through advertising/referrals, and addressing a critical missing piece in the industry—standardized sourcing ([00:33:29](#00:33:29)). They advocated for including substance-specific details (e.g., *cubensis* or *sclerosia*) as additional drop-down options in the selector ([00:34:16](#00:34:16)).

* **Networking Value through Aggregated Data**: Trevor agreed on the value of networking, noting that the tool's strength lies in aggregating data to show, for example, that "86% of treatments had a positive outcome with that strain," once practitioner preferences are understood ([00:36:11](#00:36:11)).

* **Branding and Credibility Through Landing Page Design**: Trevor presented the live domain's landing page, which they redid to appear scientific and credible, avoiding excessive mentions of "psychedelic" to maintain search engine visibility and appeal to figures like Dr. Allen ([00:37:38](#00:37:38)). The page is designed to appear as a scientific tool that augments intelligence ([00:38:17](#00:38:17)).

* **New Workflow Structure and Customization**: Trevor initiated the walkthrough by showing the new workflow, which begins with a three-phase introduction screen and then allows users to select a new or existing patient ([00:41:28](#00:41:28)). A new feature is the option for users to select their desired features, choosing between "Clinical," "Ceremonial" (for groups like Bridger), or a custom feature list to simplify their workflow ([00:43:18](#00:43:18)).

* **Phase One Workflow Steps and Data Capture**: Trevor demonstrated Phase One, which now includes a more logical, four-step flow ([00:45:08](#00:45:08)). They showed how informed consent is captured, how psychometric scores (like PHQ9s) are entered, and how safety checks trigger, noting that the logic is becoming sharper and more refined ([00:47:15](#00:47:15)).

* **Network Integration Points and Medical Advice**: Jason noted that the safety check page is a perfect intersection point for network functionality, where warnings could trigger links to practitioners with similar experiences ([00:47:54](#00:47:54)). Trevor suggested that this functionality could be peppered throughout the process, limited to only those practitioners who explicitly opt-in and potentially to only MDs to avoid providing unauthorized medical advice ([00:49:33](#00:49:33)).

* **Completion of Phase One and Transition to Phase Two**: Trevor showed the completion of the four Phase One steps, including clinical observations and vitals entry, noting that all data can be exported and an eligibility check is run. Phase Two immediately displays warnings, such as a contraindication between lithium and psilocybin ([00:50:55](#00:50:55)) ([00:52:48](#00:52:48)).

* **Dosage and Substance Tracking Improvements**: During Phase Two, Trevor demonstrated the dosage entry, which includes measurements for milligrams, grams, and drops, and confirmed that the batch tracking area is reserved for the future implementation of the potency normalization feature ([00:53:43](#00:53:43)).

* **Initial Session Setup and Vitals Entry**: Trevor demonstrated the smoother process for initiating a new session, which now automatically preloads the patient's existing information so they do not have to re-enter anything ([00:54:13](#00:54:13)). The new system allows for quick entries of vitals, such as temperature or respiratory rate, and includes scales for jaw clenching and the "dietalysis" or sweating scale, as previously discussed with Dr. Allen. Jason confirmed that the logic for loading previous session data is still present, but the user is no longer required to click a load button as it autopopulates ([00:54:54](#00:54:54)).

* **Multiple Vitals Readings and Session Start**: Trevor clarified that the same screen is used every time they need to enter vitals, even if the session has not officially started, and that there is an option to "add another reading" which auto time stamps the new entry. Jason understood that this screen is designed to log timestamped vitals readings throughout the process, and they can save this information before starting the dosing session ([00:55:32](#00:55:32)). Once the session begins, a clock starts running, and practitioners can activate a rescue protocol for patient comfort, such as verbal reassurance, which is also timestamped ([00:56:12](#00:56:12)).

* **In-Session Updates and Logging**: Jason inquired about a standard update button for monitoring a session when everything is proceeding normally, rather than just the rescue protocol or adverse event buttons ([00:57:01](#00:57:01)). Trevor explained they planned to utilize the open space on the screen to preload drop-down boxes for quick logging of notes, while also mentioning a solution for typing notes using a predictive analysis feature ([00:57:46](#00:57:46)). The current interface includes a session log feature built into the screen for logging notes ([00:59:09](#00:59:09)).

* **Logging Additional Dosing and Monitoring**: Jason asked how to log subsequent actions like a second dose of medication during a session, which is a common practice at the one or two-hour mark. Trevor confirmed that they would go back into the "amend more syllus" section, and since the timer is running, every change or entry, including amendments to dosing, gets added to the log as a separate timestamped data point ([00:59:57](#00:59:57)). Jason expressed approval for this logging functionality, recognizing its importance for tracking detailed session events ([01:00:38](#01:00:38)).

* **Patient-Facing Experience and Tracking**: Trevor introduced a separate patient screen that can be placed on a tablet during the session, allowing the patient to log how they are feeling without consulting the doctor. This screen, which includes visual elements like spinning circles, serves as both a communication tool for the patient to express feelings and a distraction tool, and it logs their entries as they go ([01:01:08](#01:01:08)). Jason found this feature to be a beneficial and slick addition ([01:02:04](#01:02:04)).

* **Post-Session Assessment Workflow**: Following the end of the session, the system automatically takes them to post-session assessments, starting with a quick experience check based on standard questions ([01:02:44](#01:02:44)). The system is designed to allow practitioners to select assessment modules, such as GAD 7, either for their specific practice or to create custom ones ([01:03:38](#01:03:38)). The entry of scores is streamlined, allowing users to enter numbers which auto-advance to the next field, concluding with an assessment score that can optionally be shared with the patient ([01:04:21](#01:04:21)).

* **Integration of Treatment Scores**: Trevor demonstrated "phase three," the integration screen, which shows the results of the most recent session integrated with the patient's whole series of treatments over time. Jason deemed this integration feature "brilliant" and exactly what is needed. They also suggested a future capability where the system could automatically send out post-treatment questionnaire updates via email to the patient, with the patient's selection updating their table ([01:05:54](#01:05:54)).

* **Patient Portal for Inter-Session Care**: Trevor confirmed that a patient portal concept is already built in, which allows practitioners to send forms for patients to fill out in advance or between sessions, as the treatment is designed to be ongoing ([01:06:51](#01:06:51)). Jason proposed an advanced feature where the system could trigger an email alert to the practitioner if a patient uses the portal to report a relapse, allowing for timely follow-up. Trevor confirmed this proposed feature is a great idea ([01:07:27](#01:07:27)).

* **Reviewing the New Protocol Workflow**: Jason suggested reviewing the creation of a new session and noted that certain demographic information, such as age, was prepopulated when it should not have been ([01:09:46](#01:09:46)). They emphasized that the first step when creating a new protocol should be defining the condition being treated, such as PTSD, as this guides the selection of the appropriate assessment scores. Trevor acknowledged this as perfect and helpful feedback, confirming that the reason for the patient's visit should be one of the very first data points collected ([01:11:12](#01:11:12)).

* **Proposal for Future Dr. Allen Demos**: Jason suggested focusing the next demonstration for Dr. Allen on a "new patient" module, followed by a subsequent session focused on editing or modifying that patient for follow-up care ([01:11:56](#01:11:56)). When creating a new patient, the initial screens should capture basic demographics and the condition being treated, as well as enabling the practitioner to select which specific assessment forms (e.g., GAD 7\) they want loaded for scoring ([01:12:39](#01:12:39)). Jason plans to schedule a 40-minute demo session with Dr. Allen, likely on Wednesday, to cover the new patient module ([01:15:05](#01:15:05)).

* **Substance Library and Receptor Affinity Profile**: The discussion shifted to the Substance Library, specifically the receptive affinity profile, where Jason noted that the spider graph points were not changing correctly when selecting different substances like MDMA or psilocybin ([01:16:21](#01:16:21)). This data needs to be updated so that the receptor binding points are accurately mapped to each substance, which is key for comparing different substances based on targeted receptors. Trevor noted this was likely due to the static data and that they would double-check the implementation ([01:18:11](#01:18:11)).

* **Targeting Receptors for Treatment**: Jason highlighted the importance of being able to target specific receptors, such as D2 for mood enhancing or NMDA for calmness, and then identifying the best substance for that target ([01:19:06](#01:19:06)). They stressed that this advanced level of association—linking receptors, substances, and treatment outcomes—would significantly "steepen that learning curve" for practitioners and advance the industry ([01:20:43](#01:20:43)). Trevor received this as great feedback and indicated that they might be able to implement much of it quickly, noting that a receptor comparison feature is already built ([01:19:06](#01:19:06)) ([01:21:24](#01:21:24)).

* **Design Feedback on Substance Library Layout**: Jason requested a design change for the substance library to reduce excessive scrolling, suggesting the use of accordion menus to display the large amount of data, especially for non-scientists. Trevor agreed that the main section was taking up too much real estate and confirmed that an accordion menu would be a great way to tighten up the layout and display data more efficiently, especially on mobile devices ([01:22:13](#01:22:13)).

* **Mobile Sharing and Transparency Features**: Trevor mentioned setting up mobile sharing, enabling "two click sharing" via a QR code at conferences to help create viral word of mouth, allowing people to access samples before signing up ([01:23:30](#01:23:30)). Jason praised the inclusion of study references throughout the site, particularly alongside risk information, as it provides a solid foundation for transparency ([01:24:27](#heading=h.hfhwrpnua30r)).

* **Next Steps and Development Commitment**: Jason will try to schedule the demonstration with Dr. Allen for Wednesday, focusing on the new protocol module, and will spend time reviewing the new system updates ([01:25:12](#heading=h.eoe05tpgvusv)). Trevor expressed enthusiasm for the potential of the project and offered to implement many of the discussed changes before the Wednesday demo ([01:25:48](#heading=h.m40x3nkyfbt9)). They requested that Jason continue to test and report any system issues, such as incorrect button functionality ([01:26:22](#heading=h.7y3vdthniyjd)).

### **Suggested next steps**

- [ ] Jason will go back through and re-update his notes with the changes and updates in the system.  
- [ ] Jason and Trevor will schedule a call with Dr. Allen for the end of the week to do a walkthrough and let him demo the product to get his preliminary feedback.  
- [ ] Jason will try to schedule a short 40-minute demo session with Dr. Allen, preferably on Wednesday, to focus on the 'new patient' module.  
- [ ] Trevor will update the in-session screen to include a general update button with pre-loaded drop-down boxes, separate from rescue protocol or adverse reactions.  
- [ ] Trevor will update the new protocol workflow to first capture: (1) what is being treated (e.g., PTSD), (2) demographic info (age and gender), and (3) selected assessment forms (e.g., GAD 7).  
- [ ] Trevor will ensure the affinity profile on the substance library screen updates dynamically based on the selected substance, as the data appears static currently.  
- [ ] Trevor will update the substance library screen to reduce the real estate footprint of the hero section by laying out items horizontally and using accordion menus for scientific data.  
- [ ] Jason will continue testing and make notes of any issues, such as back buttons not working correctly, to provide feedback to Trevor.  
- [ ] Jason will go through the new menu items and update his notes after seeing the revisions.

## **Jason : Trevor 2/23/26 \- Transcript**

### **00:00:00**

   
**Jason:** Hey bud, how's it going? Must be on mute again. How's your weekend? Still can't hear you, bud. Nope.  
 

### **00:03:08** {#00:03:08}

   
**Jason:** What this is and what this isn't. So things like it's not EHS and just kind of document those. But then also I started to realize and so it was more helpful for me and and so maybe just be patient for my learning process. But I put together my initial list and I just it would be a way for us to align on things and then also back burner things because I'm finding that I'll say something and I don't I don't necessarily expect it to be included always but yet you're including it more so some of the times it's which is great but also that's we need to focus in on like the five to 10 things and that's my intention. So I I want to kind of walk through the scope stuff. I have a document to share and I tried to post this on the the link that you gave me just the other day that's got like the Jason Monday update just from anyway it was just the what stuff you sent just the other day but I didn't have access to so I'll just share it and then I'll just email it over or do you want me to post it  
   
   
   
 

### **00:05:32** {#00:05:32}

   
**Jason:** And then and then also we can start talking about order of stuff. I saw you know I saw your kind of bridger letter. We could talk about that of course when we get there but I'm thinking I don't know what your thoughts are but I agree with approaching Bridger. I think we need to have something a little almost done. I think a little bit more anyway but I think we can still have a conversation high level and what that looks like for him on the on beta testing and timing. But I think first shouldn't we circle back with Dr. Allen and kind of he's he's now given us all this information and he hasn't seen anything.  
**Trevor:** I'm ready to show to him.  
**Jason:** I kind of feel was that okay cool so I can start getting on his calendar.  
**Trevor:** I'm ready to show it to him.  
**Jason:** I wanted to wait till today's combo but if you're good then I am as well because we can talk around stuff and then capture.  
   
 

### **00:06:20** {#00:06:20}

   
**Jason:** So okay cool cool. yeah.  
**Trevor:** Agreed.  
**Jason:** So what I was just this is just normal just kind of how my brain works project management wise is what is what is in scope what's out of scope and some stuff like as I was going through I found functionality that I think should be there but that may just need to be put on the back burner. You know what I mean once we agree and so I'm trying to I'm trying to clean that up because I know I pepper you with a lot of stuff and then stuff changes and  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** I'm kind of trying to create a tracker but it will also help when we go to talk to people we're saying the same thing. and say, "Nope, this is not that." And I'm trying to flush that out because then it helps my brain when I review to narrow in.  
**Trevor:** Yep.  
**Jason:** So, um, that's the intent here, but I I I don't know if you can see my screen.  
   
 

### **00:06:56** {#00:06:56}

   
**Jason:** Okay. Okay. So,  
**Trevor:** Yep.  
**Jason:** so I just did highlevel stuff, but I want you to comment and massage as well. So, the the stuff it is not, and this I think I need some help with. It's not an EH system. We've talked about that. And it's not really a pre-screening tool. It's, you know, that was kind of what I realized the other day. It could be. Maybe that's maybe that's I'll put this down a pre-screening  
**Trevor:** Do you want me to answer that one at a time?  
**Jason:** pre-screen tool. Yeah, just kind of just provide feedback.  
**Trevor:** Because this will let me just tell you.  
**Jason:** Yeah, if I'm capturing these incorrectly. So, we're not we're neither one of  
   
 

### **00:07:28** {#00:07:28}

   
**Trevor:** So, an EHS system will typically do treatment,  
**Jason:** those,  
**Trevor:** but it'll also do billing, insurance, um,  
**Jason:** right?  
**Trevor:** scheduling, all that. What what I did is I stripped out all of the extraneous stuff and  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** created the treatment compliance tracking, right? So no billing, no patient, no basically like this is this will work for Bridger perfectly. where he can protect his patients privacy,  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** the the practitioner's privacy, but still show documentation that they are doing everything right. So, it's really like if you think the EHS system is this and the the treatment part is this,  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** this is what we did and then I tweaked it so it's got a gate and a privacy wall. Um, so I'm not trying to replace their entire system because then we got to get into HIPPA. So,  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** what I did is I isolated it and and you'll see,  
   
 

### **00:08:23** {#00:08:23}

   
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** man, wait till you see the full workflow because we didn't get into it the other day. Um, and so,  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** so this is really just for that treatment like like what Dr. Allen like the scope of his phone call where he was like at this point I've already decided that they're coming in and they're we're going to treat them. That's the starting point, but I did put a bunch of that extra stuff for pre-screening it like the MEQ30 and all that that Sarah  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** asked about.  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** So there's there's some pre-screening  
**Jason:** And so I kind of captured that. Yeah. And so it's it's I kind of captured as like a postcreening treatment and follow-up logging tool. multiple sessions just to kind of just to kind of call out of scope that it's not the pre-screen tool, but it could be potentially down the road.  
   
 

### **00:09:08** {#00:09:08}

   
**Jason:** Like Bridger is going to want a pre-screen tool, right? Because he's system guy and he knows that it it could be done, but it's a I want to box it appropriately. Regulatory compliance. I had the whole point of this thing I you know, we cannot we can't lose a focus of is this was meant to build a network not of just treatments but of people, right? And so and so I'm always wearing that hat or looking at through those lenses. How do we get people to interact and share and and so that is a big part of it. So like the pro the profiles I have one question when we look at some of the you know issues like just you know a contract diction or something occurs when you're in the middle of a session you know a function where it pulls up other people who may have had similar things that you can you know send a message to directly.  
   
 

### **00:09:56** {#00:09:56}

   
**Jason:** or call directly like it's the people the people connecting part is is really critical to this in addition to the treatment. So I I kind of got that in there. more post screening safety IDs all the stuff we have in there for pharmacological natural medicine maybe need to expand and yeah just the network parts. That's kind of what I had as the incope. I think that makes sense. What I called out was not an EHS. It's not a pre-screening tool and it's no collection of anything personally identifying as regulatory compliant. Is there anything else that it's not billing?  
**Trevor:** Well,  
**Jason:** I just want to be clear  
**Trevor:** well, here's what it's not.  
**Jason:** on  
**Trevor:** It's not it it will facilitate billing and it'll allow people who are running patient names and getting reimbursements from insurance to do that,  
   
 

### **00:10:43** {#00:10:43}

   
**Jason:** Uh-huh.  
**Trevor:** but the the key the key thing here was protecting privacy, right? And that was not because to accommodate the people that are operating illegally, right? Um, so I sent you a document that was called why no  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** PHI. Did you see that?  
**Jason:** much I looked at so many dude.  
**Trevor:** That's okay. Put it on my to-do list. Yeah, that's what I I'm trying not to I I I totally received what you were saying about like learning styles and  
**Jason:** Sorry.  
**Trevor:** stuff. And so once we get a system, I'll work within that system for you.  
**Jason:** Same same.  
**Trevor:** and and so anyway, we can we can move on.  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** I will I created a document that explains why I took this approach for you. and it's just it's called why no PHI. and  
**Jason:** I I do remember.  
   
 

### **00:11:34**

   
**Jason:** I might even still have it up.  
**Trevor:** maybe  
**Jason:** Let me see. I do remember I do remember reading that. I mean it adds some good stuff in there,  
**Trevor:** I will be able to  
**Jason:** but it wasn't it I I think that's part of what I'm trying to make sure is the direction you took, which is great, but also there's, you know, in our conversations and value, not just the tool side, but the network, you know, bringing people together, being able to set up,  
**Trevor:** Yep.  
**Jason:** you know, meetings and facilitate quick emails or pages like I had a nausea and I saw two weeks ago you had a nausea. How did it handle it on psilocy? you know, that type of thing. Um,  
**Trevor:** Right.  
**Jason:** especially for folks that are kind of lone wolves or doing it out there, not having the medical support, you know, and then referrals type of thing.  
   
 

### **00:12:11** {#00:12:11}

   
**Trevor:** I have a solution.  
**Jason:** So,  
**Trevor:** I got a solution for  
**Jason:** um, yeah. Yeah. No, that's fine.  
**Trevor:** that.  
**Jason:** I just want to we agree it's in scope. I I just more I'm wanting to align on what it's not. Um, so anyway,  
**Trevor:** Let's go through this and I think I I can answer every one of your questions here.  
**Jason:** that's kind of this Well,  
**Trevor:** So,  
**Jason:** we have you already we already have  
**Trevor:** okay. So I agree with you about the network and what I decided is there there's two solutions and and and I decided that like there's only one way we can really do it integrated with the database but there's a great workaround if so in the in in terms of like HIPPA right and the laws and the regulations and and basically you have to register with the federal government that you are handling people's personal health information and And that's I mean we'd have to literally raise a4 million dollars for legal fees and registration and all  
   
 

### **00:13:02** {#00:13:02}

   
**Jason:** Well,  
**Trevor:** that just to start. But hold on let me let me let let me finish my thought.  
**Jason:** the the practitioners already have that, right?  
**Trevor:** but if we so that's why I took the approach that I did and in order to keep the social networking or the the communication part that you're talking about which I agree is hugely valuable. If we tied it into the database then we got all kinds of problems. So, what I did was there's two solutions and I' I'd love to hear your thoughts.  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** One is we could do prepackaged messages that still no no like, hey, please call me or hey, I'd like to talk to you or hey, may I contact you and people could could do a structured thing, but I don't like that as much. The other thing is I went and got the other two domains for ppnportal.com and.org. And what I thought we could do, this might be the answer, is and the user wouldn't be able to tell, but it like separate the two, make them seamless.  
   
 

### **00:13:57** {#00:13:57}

   
**Trevor:** So, we've got the database as its own isolated thing, and then we can create that social part on the back end. I'm like I'm looking at I'm not sure which camera I'm looking at. Um,  
**Jason:** It's okay. You're down in my right hand corner and I'm trying to look at the camera.  
**Trevor:** so um, so, uh, so we could do that. That's that's I I think that's the smarter thing because the the deal with the PHI and the HIPPA and the Feds and all that is it's not just that you don't collect personal  
**Jason:** Mhm.  
**Trevor:** information. it's that your database is structured in such a way that it would be impossible for you to collect personal information today or anytime in the future. So I'm literally going and I had to go and put down lockdowns for like it's making it in order to create this sol this solution. It's deceptively simple but it's like it's really solid architecture but then the the privacy and the encryption is literally impenetrable.  
   
 

### **00:14:54** {#00:14:54}

   
**Trevor:** It's defensible in court. It's compliant from insurance. It's HIPPA compliant. Like it solves every problem.  
**Jason:** Let me let me make sure I'm understanding.  
**Trevor:** Um  
**Jason:** Sorry. Can I can I ask because I know it's I know it's all regulatory compliant and you're designing with that in mind, but for example, let me move this out of the way. The stuff I'm talking about when I was into these are all all my notes. Okay, so like when I was doing a new protocol, right? I was creating a new protocol and a safety was triggered, right? So this this would be this would be a great opportunity to pull up there's a conflict or a safety was triggered and this is just a general thing somehow to be able to see who has had who has got experience with those triggers as a result of the tool, right?  
   
 

### **00:15:43** {#00:15:43}

   
**Jason:** and how they handled it would be in their notes potentially so I can dig through them or I can potentially just quickly send them an email or I can get their phone number and give them a call. So more so it's it's hey something happened in my session I'm going to call this person that's a medical  
**Trevor:** Okay.  
**Jason:** professional get their guidance that's the network I'm talking about right so having said that as an example how would you  
**Trevor:** Yeah. Let Okay.  
**Jason:** resp what's your  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** thought  
**Trevor:** let's go through what we have installed. When is when's the last time you looked at it? Like the trying to enter a protocol because there's  
**Jason:** let's see I did it on I did it on sat Sunday I did it  
**Trevor:** there's I don't Okay, cool. because like I finished a bunch of new updates last night and the one thing is that that is certainly possible but again I think the solution there would be adding a link if the providers wanted to share their information adding a link to the that warning and have it pop them over to the outside of the database.  
   
 

### **00:16:45** {#00:16:45}

   
**Jason:** Okay. So, you think like a link would come a link would come  
**Trevor:** I think that that's yeah so like right now when I show you the the  
**Jason:** up,  
**Trevor:** demo you know if you run the contra indication checker and you get a warning about like psilocybin and lithium right at the bottom there there's a link to the source of that information.  
**Jason:** right?  
**Trevor:** So because what I really what the other thing we have to get into is not we're not giving medical advice. We're not recommending care. That's between them. We don't actually want that on our site. And I'm telling you, if you if you insist on that, then we have to change our business model. We got to go raise money first because we can't afford to build that. that takes a team of  
**Jason:** Well, you can't can't afford to build it right now.  
**Trevor:** designers.  
**Jason:** I these are the requests, right?  
   
 

### **00:17:32** {#00:17:32}

   
**Jason:** And as we've been talking with, so I understand what you're saying. This is why we're having this conversation. But the whole point is again network, right? And so, yeah, it may be down the road or a different bit or we have to raise. I don't know what the answer is and it may be out of scope. That's why I'm trying to scope it. I just It was just a reminder this focus is.  
**Trevor:** I see an easy solution.  
**Jason:** But anyway,  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** how do you So, um, how do I have a bunch of stuff to go through. How you said you just wanted me to see the system and then go through them or what do you what do you  
**Trevor:** Well,  
**Jason:** think?  
**Trevor:** I I what I'd like to do is walk you through it and see how many of your questions are answered in the walkthrough and then let's do questions that aren't answered.  
   
 

### **00:18:10** {#00:18:10}

   
**Trevor:** because that way why I looking at it at the same time will it's just more efficient. Like let's keep your questions up and look at my screen. and let me show you just what's addressed because a lot of the like the pre-screen tool is in there. Um, you know, but we're also we need to be remembering that our time is going to be better spent once we've put this in front of Dr. Allen and said how it really works, right? We're not doctors. So, we got to ask the doctors what they want and we have now what I can I mean it's it's actually working. Uh, we've got a defensible product. So, let's get it in front of them before we start trying to antic because our probability of needing to do rework goes way up if we do it before we talk to them and we put it in front of them. Don't you agree?  
**Jason:** Yeah. Also, we just talked about this on on Friday, right?  
   
 

### **00:19:05** {#00:19:05}

   
**Jason:** That before we present to that, we're going to get here. Here's how I'm feeling, just so you know. Um, I have all these questions I want to go through. I'm fine with the order of it, but now you're pushing me to I did a bunch of changes. Let's get in front of people. And I'm coming from the I finally saw the tool for the first time. I made a bunch of notes that I want to go through. Yeah, I want to sort through those. That's great. And then after that, yes, 100% we want to get to Dr. Allen, but I I I need to go through these questions and things I noted. and  
**Trevor:** You're misunderstanding me. I I totally agreed with you and I was like,  
**Jason:** well  
**Trevor:** let's go through your questions, but let's do it while we have the system up so I can not just answer because if you're not looking at it,  
   
 

### **00:19:45**

   
**Jason:** okay.  
**Trevor:** then you're not understanding what I'm trying to explain and I'm not communicating it  
**Jason:** Sure. Sure. I I'm flexible on the order of things.  
**Trevor:** well.  
**Jason:** How do you want to go? How do you want to do  
**Trevor:** Yeah. I wasn't saying we should get it in front of Allen before answering your questions at all.  
**Jason:** it?  
**Trevor:** I I just want to show you so that Yeah.  
**Jason:** That's why I asked, my friend. FY asked.  
**Trevor:** Yeah. Let Let's get it going. And  
**Jason:** So, I'm just going to go up to I have general questions that  
**Trevor:** um  
**Jason:** I I guess I can say that aren't spa page specific as much.  
**Trevor:** you Yeah.  
**Jason:** Let's see here.  
**Trevor:** And and you can um  
   
 

### **00:20:19**

   
**Jason:** It's just it's just orient questions about the tool,  
**Trevor:** let's  
**Jason:** the design, but more so like other stuff like it it's got, you know, I've got good good things that we want to kind of pull out and some research I did and stuff too.  
**Trevor:** Yeah. And and I want I we are actually totally aligned. Um, I want you I agree that like the the the networking part is incredibly important and and that's why we've we've we've got to figure out that solution that works within the law, you know, because I if Yeah.  
**Jason:** I know you don't have to go through that all. I  
**Trevor:** And so so the I've been thinking about those things and I agree with you 100%.  
**Jason:** understand.  
**Trevor:** All right, let's do this. Um,  
**Jason:** Yeah, we're good.  
**Trevor:** what's your what's your first question in terms of like let's let's go through and get your questions  
   
 

### **00:21:20** {#00:21:20}

   
**Jason:** Well,  
**Trevor:** answered.  
**Jason:** um, initially, yeah, there'll just be kind of loose questions, but then when we get into Let me Why am I I'm not sharing still, am I?  
**Trevor:** No, I'm sharing  
**Jason:** Yeah, that's what I thought. My window is really big. my first one was more so so we kind of see where do you see and this just kind of for getting in your design head where do you see the tool intersecting into the process of like u a therapist kind of post pre-screen or what do you kind of see them first going oh I got to get the tool open they talked with the client what what did what did you what's the use case you you  
**Trevor:** Th this is this is the core treatment tracking. So what what what Dr.  
**Jason:** Good.  
**Trevor:** Allen said was I mean literally this is just what we covered in his in that call where we're you know we we didn't talk about how he gets through that interview process or how he gets those referrals.  
   
 

### **00:22:20** {#00:22:20}

   
**Trevor:** We talked about what's happens when the patient comes into his office and all the way  
**Jason:** Heat.  
**Trevor:** through to the point where the patient walks out the door. Okay. anything beyond that billing insurance we are facilitating  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** getting from let's say that in the big picture like there's there's treatment okay we've got that eight hour session in his office let's call that the treatment the whole treatment protocol you know basically from walking into the door of the office on the day you're going to get treated until you walk out the door so right now what they can't do is and  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** it It's different for every for every segment, but they can't like get the patient in, get them treated and track them and protect their privacy and get reimbursed by insurance, right? Um, so think about what we have done is is strictly we're not we are giving them the the the ability to track everything that's going on and the ability to report it without violating anybody's privacy.  
   
 

### **00:23:30**

   
**Jason:** Okay. All right. Yeah,  
**Trevor:** so they can use it to bill insurance.  
**Jason:** that makes sense. Just kind of a general alignment on that one.  
**Trevor:** Same thing with Bridger, like we're giving Bridger the ability to prove in court that they are conducting their  
**Jason:** Um,  
**Trevor:** ceremonies or their treatments the right way without revealing their patients identities.  
**Jason:** okay. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Uh, the rest of the questions are just kind of general functionality things. I don't need to go through those now. We can talk about those later. Um, I did have I did have a question. I don't know if you've thought of this and I wanted to maybe flag as a potential help. So if someone goes through and they're searching protocols, right, or practitioner, whatever it is, and I have detailed comments on that, but that's a little too detailed for now.  
   
 

### **00:24:13** {#00:24:13}

   
**Jason:** Would there be a way for let's say they find a protocol that they like could would it be easy to do a function where it's like create a template? So, in other words, you know, they've they've gone through, they don't have to prepopulate based on someone else's 25 meg, you know, dose. Otherwise, because I'm thinking these folks would have to probably look up a protocol, print it, then they'd have to go create a new protocol. There should be some easy way to port that over. So, they can just say copy protocol and it's has nothing, add a new name, but it starts out with the basic stuff like the dosing or the the the product and if they're addressing, you know, PTSD.  
**Trevor:** Um, so yes, yes and no. Um, and the the distinction between those two is whether or not we're giving medical advice.  
**Jason:** No,  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** it's more it's more just we're not it's just I like  
   
 

### **00:25:03**

   
**Trevor:** but they can look up and see the statistics on the various.  
**Jason:** it's  
**Trevor:** So great question. They will be able to look up and see exactly which protocols have the best results. And  
**Jason:** but a specific protocol, right?  
**Trevor:** the  
**Jason:** They can look at how a specific protocol is handled with the similar characteristics like failures.  
**Trevor:** yeah if I'm understanding your question correctly yes may articulate the question  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** again.  
**Jason:** So let's say so so I go in and I say this is the very first I'm referencing back to our kind of the very first search right when it was I have a 35-year-old woman who's you know on SSRIs or she's experienced drug user and I do that as the search and it pulls up right now it kind of just it it pull it doesn't really pull up a ton of useful information from what that use case is that use case is here's 10 people filtered by the most recent 10 cases with similar characteristics female this weight, this age, you know, all the stuff that was in the protocol and then how it went, what substances were we used.  
   
 

### **00:26:06** {#00:26:06}

   
**Jason:** So, you should be able to pull up and see that entire protocol and how to this esoteric nonidentifiable person it was approached and any issues kind of like a it's a it's a pre-work function, right? Part of your, you know, 20 or 30 minutes like Sarah was saying she has to spend on each client, but it it does that for you. And then you would go, "Oh, cool. Who did this?" Dr. Allen did this one, right? And here's his phone number if I want to contact him. I don't but I do want to use this as my template because it's almost exactly the same as the person coming in tomorrow. Let me go and just copy the template the pro anything that was entered you know to just to kind of save time and then now I have him as a reference and now I have a starting a template for the protocol I'll be using for an identical situation that's that's that's now people are learning from each other is here's a good baseline and then I compare that against whatever their agency requires or or you know the state or whatever.  
   
 

### **00:26:59**

   
**Trevor:** Yep.  
**Jason:** So that functionality is that's that's that's exactly what we kind of talked to people about at first. So I just want to make sure that's not not missed.  
**Trevor:** We're totally aligned and and yeah, we're good. Um, and the the tricky part I and this will be a question for like a legal counsel  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** is you know but I think we've solved that workound in terms of letting people connect by just having them on a different domain.  
**Jason:** Yeah, that's different. This is let me be as clear as I can.  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** I go in and I search and I get five results for women and 35 and that are still assignment. I want to see the details of person number one and I click on that protocol.  
**Trevor:** Yep. Yep.  
**Jason:** Is the protocol displayed or not and who the who the physician is,  
   
 

### **00:27:44** {#00:27:44}

   
**Trevor:** It  
**Jason:** what they treated,  
**Trevor:** it  
**Jason:** what the success factors were, what what the end result was, all that's available for viewing and printing.  
**Trevor:** will be it's not yet,  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** but it will be and it will be not just the individual  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** protocol. They'll be able to see the entire data set of that and they'll be able to see the statistics.  
**Jason:** Perfect. Perfect.  
**Trevor:** So, they'll they'll be able to filter by a ton of different things.  
**Jason:** Okay. Okay. Awesome. Yeah. and that's a So that's what I'm trying to understand. And the I think the answer is perfect. It's like yes, that's where we're headed. It's not there yet. Perfect.  
   
 

### **00:28:18**

   
**Jason:** Now I won't even think that it's missing. Okay. Not yet. And also like you said, get practitioner input, right? Because it's all about helping them.  
**Trevor:** Yeah. And and that's why I think we're in a good place because I I can verify that the database  
**Jason:** Um  
**Trevor:** is tracking the that whole patient journey, the treatment. I called it the wellness journey. We can rename it if we want, but I just I I needed to put a name in there.  
**Jason:** dude, it's it's perfect.  
**Trevor:** perfect.  
**Jason:** Some place called Voyage.  
**Trevor:** Okay. Um,  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** so because the the the thing is functional and I I think it's intuitive and that's what I'm excited to get your take on. Um, is I if you agree once we get through this today,  
**Jason:** Okay.  
   
 

### **00:29:03** {#00:29:03}

   
**Trevor:** if you agree, I I believe we're ready to let Dr. Allen test it. Um,  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** at least give us his pre preliminary feedback.  
**Jason:** Would you want to do like a a quick overview training type  
**Trevor:** But I think he's Huh.  
**Jason:** sesh and then let turn in loose or what do you  
**Trevor:** Yeah, I think we should do a walkthrough with him and and let him and he may say,  
**Jason:** think?  
**Trevor:** "Oh, you know, I want this won't work, that won't work, and we can change it then. Let him demo it." Like, but I think we should set up a call with him whenever you're  
**Jason:** Okay. I I'm down.  
**Trevor:** ready.  
**Jason:** We just set up for the end of the week and that'll give us a little pressure to get this banged out. Cool.  
**Trevor:** It might be ready today. I'll let you decide.  
   
 

### **00:29:41** {#00:29:41}

   
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** so you let's  
**Jason:** Um, next a couple other things that that really that was my main question.  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** All my questions are really is this capable now or on the road map or that's so so I'm not we're not misled. I did want to flag at the on the start page. I went through and we don't there's it says 15,000 practitioners and and also then on your your business sheet I really only found about about 900 right between Oregon that are licensed and Colorado that are that are facilitator training not even licensed ones yet.  
**Trevor:** That was dummy data.  
**Jason:** How did you find all  
**Trevor:** No. Uh,  
**Jason:** yours?  
**Trevor:** anything that you saw or like so one of my principles is absolutely zero fabrication, embellishment, exaggeration or any falsities of any kind. There will be we will never represent anything that we haven't verified to be factually true.  
   
 

### **00:30:33**

   
**Jason:** Agreed.  
**Trevor:** Any any because credibility is everything.  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** Anything that you may have seen on there was probably just placeholder text. Um,  
**Jason:** Okay. Okay.  
**Trevor:** a lot of it was put in there by the AI. And by all means, if you anything that you spot,  
**Jason:** Perfect.  
**Trevor:** you're like, "Hey, we need to verify this." Um, you'll notice that I tried to put tool tips on everything that gives a citation as to where the data source is or how it's calculated. Um, and just so I we're aligned, but just so you know that anything like that where it's a statistic should have been taken  
**Jason:** Okay, perfect. And I've made notes and I've downloaded forms,  
**Trevor:** out.  
**Jason:** so I'm helping to gather that info, just FYI. So, great, great. That's good.  
   
 

### **00:31:13** {#00:31:13}

   
**Jason:** because that that also plays into whatever numbers,  
**Trevor:** Awesome.  
**Jason:** you know, as we're looking for VC funding and whatnot. a lot of my other stuff, I'm just looking through my list. Most of it is just feature questions or order of things. some things didn't skip around, right? But we're not quite to that's what I mean. We're not quite to that level. I did notice Oh, I noticed you left in the state page that Sarah didn't find was useful.  
**Trevor:** Oh,  
**Jason:** Did you take that out?  
**Trevor:** I took it out. Yeah,  
**Jason:** Update. Okay, perfect.  
**Trevor:** it's gone.  
**Jason:** Okay. let's see. New protocol. We already talked about that. dosing.  
   
 

### **00:31:51** {#00:31:51}

   
**Jason:** Yeah, some order stuff. Okay, let's see. Sorry, men. Um, we already talked about putting the the aligning or expanding the like the PHQ9's just for depression, PTSD. There's a whole bunch of different ones. And each also this each each substance has their own sort of their own receptor mappings or affinities. So, those would need to be specific. We already talked about that. Oh, I did want to talk about the potency normalizer. Dude, that's a tough one. Let me let me just let me just Okay.  
**Trevor:** It's on the back burner. It was when I Yeah. Yeah.  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** I  
**Jason:** The per good but we can still use it but it's is it almost like we have the capability we intend to go there but right now all we're doing is capturing data if it's available.  
   
 

### **00:32:39**

   
**Trevor:** What I wanted to do, uh, just my thinking there was throw a bunch of noodles against the wall to see what would stick  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** and and put kind of like potential features because Sarah's feedback was really good,  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** like, oh, that's useful, but that's not, right? Um, and so I'll and I'll I'll I'll give you some of my thinking,  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** but but everything like that, like that potency normalizer, the Apple Watch integration,  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** that's all been either taken out or locked to just show Dr.  
**Jason:** Yep. Perfect.  
**Trevor:** Allen. Um, so,  
**Jason:** Well, it drives understand that that having that ability,  
**Trevor:** uh,  
**Jason:** dude, is we're we're definitely be heading that way and having I think there's something that applies, you know, applies a little bit of pressure because I'm in the business of supplying standardized substances for exactly this reason.  
   
 

### **00:33:29** {#00:33:29}

   
**Jason:** So, potency normal we is the way to go. The question will be and where it gets interesting is when we do start working with the suppliers, right, and we start developing a standard of sources. Now, they're going to pay for their testing or it maybe it's maybe it's network pricing, but it opens them up to, hey, I got the same shroom because we're the whole point normalizing. So, that is a huge opportunity. Um, and you see it, but that that one right there is a is an income stream as well, right, for advertising and referrals and that that helps that helps everybody immensely because no, that's how we got into this whole idea was Chris and I are at conferences and they're like, "Yeah, they tell you how to they tell you how to do these sessions, but they don't tell you where to get your s\*\*\*." And it was like and and I we were and so that's why we've there's  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
   
 

### **00:34:16** {#00:34:16}

   
**Jason:** been such a pull with all these doctors is they said, "Dang, we really appreciate what you guys have put together." And then it was like well if you're not sharing product how are you sharing information and it was like oh we don't do that at all like so you don't sell you don't share product there's no standard you don't share even your and here we are today so so that really was the impetus so some sort of grad gradient not full capacity but starting to capture which not only 25 milligrams but 25 milligrams of what cubenz right sclorenzi like the different categories that there are I think I sent that over to Um, and then there's or put it in my notes so I'll share. But then under there there's five or 10 or 20 different ones. Um, dancing tiger, purple mystic, all the stuff that we make. And then there's the potency number. So just having the basics because a lot of these guys are doing stuff.  
   
 

### **00:35:06**

   
**Jason:** They don't even realize that there are more than just cubenzies hallucinogenic mushrooms. there's four or five other categories that maybe maybe your your you know what you're trying to solve wouldn't work with cubenes but you see somebody else used the sclerosia so then they use that they start using that and you're like oh my god I didn't even know it existed and now I have a protocol for it do you see what I mean this type of that's the  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** stuff where where people start getting their minds blown and you that's why I I want to have a degree or I would encourage us to have a degree of maybe not potency but certainly those additional drop downs in the substance selector because especially on the psilocybin which is what the world's opening up to first bro we can really create some education and some knowledge and with the spidergrams like I can't I'll stop talking because I know you heard me but I cannot emphasize enough how much this will bolster everything about this tool and it's just a great opportunity and I would hate for us to not get it so I'm just putting it out there it's done but it's a biggie and I love it I just think we have to kind of baby step towards it.  
   
 

### **00:36:11** {#00:36:11}

   
**Jason:** I guess all I'm  
**Trevor:** Yeah. Yeah. Because there's a lot of questions and variables to go in there.  
**Jason:** saying  
**Trevor:** But what we could do is like you said, we can use the network to do that for us by creating a rating system, you know,  
**Jason:** Wait.  
**Trevor:** and but the the value comes in the aggregation like, oh, you know,  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** 86% of treatments had a positive outcome with that strain or that, you know, whatever. and so once we know what people want, that'll be great. so yeah  
**Jason:** Okay. Well, that's I want to emphasize I'm I'm actually pretty much done.  
**Trevor:** and  
**Jason:** That's really I have a lot of other detail stuff, but it's moot at this point because I need to see it. But anyway, thanks for listening. the the the the additional drop downs are crucial,  
   
 

### **00:36:49**

   
**Trevor:** yeah no these are good comments.  
**Jason:** bro. That we'll be able to sell licensing or people will be growers will be clamoring to be certified in our database, which then helps eliminate the variables in the treatments. Like it's it's just crucial. So anyway,  
**Trevor:** And yeah, I love it. And we're we're totally aligned and and the the the kind of the sort of  
**Jason:** okay.  
**Trevor:** principle I've been operating on is like this is a trust engine. This is this is something that people can if they are so confident that this is trustworthy and good and reliable, then the patients will start demanding it.  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** and so Yep.  
**Jason:** They'll ask for it. Are you PPN certified?  
**Trevor:** Yep.  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** So, okay. Um, and by the way, I'm in no rush,  
**Jason:** Okay.  
   
 

### **00:37:38** {#00:37:38}

   
**Trevor:** so I I don't want you to feel like you have to stop talking. If you got more things you want to like go for it, like a ask away. I just thought like if you're if it's something where like I can show you the answer. Um, I wanted to have the the site up, but I don't know if you took a look at this, but I'm really really happy with the landing page. I I redid this. It's it's all it's got a  
**Jason:** Mine didn't take me there. So, all I got was the J the JSON private.  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** So, no, this is great. The JSON private thing and then I logged into the tool. So, this I had kind of that special landing page, I guess. So, this is  
**Trevor:** yeah. And if you go,  
**Jason:** great.  
**Trevor:** this is a live domain right now.  
   
 

### **00:38:17** {#00:38:17}

   
**Trevor:** Um, so if you go to the domain,  
**Jason:** Okay,  
**Trevor:** it this is what you'll see.  
**Jason:** let me let me Oh, cool.  
**Trevor:** so and I you know I was like okay what I what I tried to do was make sure that this is this is and you mentioned this in one of our very first comment or meetings was that like Dr. Dr. Allen was saying like a lot of the science would go a long way to giving this credibility and if we were like oh mushrooms this and ketamine that and psilocybin that we would get we would get flagged by other sites you know search engines potentially.  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** So this is really meant to be presented as a a scientific kind of tool like a this is and so for credibility purposes.  
**Jason:** Yes.  
**Trevor:** So you'll see in here there's a couple mentions of psychedelic, but for the most part this is is really talking about how we're augmenting their intelligence.  
   
 

### **00:39:17**

   
**Trevor:** So you don't we don't have to go through this whole now, but if you have any comments on this, I think you're going to really like this.  
**Jason:** What do you think about a what kind of a chime do we need?  
**Trevor:** Um  
**Jason:** I was thinking about this literal yesterday with Viv. I was like I feel like we need a little like Intel's like something something like I don't know I'm being silly now but I agree like I'll go through and look at this part. It looks great and I've always loved this the I guess the the trope if you will of being very scientific and very credible and the dark background is actually my favorite. So, um, it's I call it the Orort network, right? The the the the things surrounding the the the solar system in space. And this is space stuff behind us.  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** It's perfect. Is this this is fringe living literally.  
   
 

### **00:40:01**

   
**Trevor:** I Yeah.  
**Jason:** So, anyway,  
**Trevor:** Every time Every time I'm like I'm like,  
**Jason:** that's  
**Trevor:** "Okay, I gotta,  
**Jason:** great.  
**Trevor:** you know, fix the brightness on this because like imagine that anybody who's looking at this might have dilated pupils, right? Um, so you can review this at any time, but this I think this presents really well and and just shows I I think people  
**Jason:** Okay,  
**Trevor:** are going to resonate with this right away.  
**Jason:** cool.  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** Cool. Okay, I'll dig through that then  
**Trevor:** and then Okay,  
**Jason:** after.  
**Trevor:** cool. Um, all right. So, let's let's get  
**Jason:** And that just let me go back to the PPN portal.  
**Trevor:** back.  
**Jason:** I'm just going to do a refresh. It was PPN portal.  
**Trevor:** Yep.  
   
 

### **00:40:43**

   
**Trevor:** Net. But if you go to com or.org, it should redirect to the same place.  
**Jason:** Oh. Oh, nice. Um, so it takes me my ppnportal.net takes me to the dashboard.  
**Trevor:** do a hard refresh. Oh, because you're logged in. If you just go log out and it logged you in  
**Jason:** Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. All righty,  
**Trevor:** automatically.  
**Jason:** sir. Sign out. Yeah, well, that makes sense. Oh, there it is.  
**Trevor:** So,  
**Jason:** Okay, cool, cool,  
**Trevor:** my my thought for for like first steps here is to kind of pick up where  
**Jason:** cool.  
**Trevor:** we left off the other day when things kind of didn't work. to show you what's changed. How does that sound to you?  
**Jason:** That sounds great.  
   
 

### **00:41:28** {#00:41:28}

   
**Jason:** And then I'll then what I'll do per your recommendation from earlier, I'll go back through and mark off or clarify my other the other stuff I had in my table since this is new and updated. It's probably not even applicable. So yes, let's let's power forward.  
**Trevor:** Okay. Um, so what the first thing that I realized doing this was was that we we shouldn't do a one-sizefits-all. So this is a cool feature that I think that is going to be really appreciated. All right. So this is just the very like the very first time people come to this screen. Here's what to expect. Okay. And and this is just this you're going to go to you're going to see three phases. You can you can click this off so you never see it again if you want. And then from here they are going to go in and they can select a new patient which you've seen right and it gives them that hash.  
   
 

### **00:42:23**

   
**Trevor:** they can go and select an existing patient and then if they want we if if they are also this is intended to be tablet first so or mobile first so there's a lot of things that were like scanner you know functions if they have like a wristband a patient wristband that they want to connect and just so they don't have to enter the information and they can it'll just automatically create the hash for that that's what this is at the bottom here. and  
**Jason:** Cool. Question question before you move on.  
**Trevor:** then  
**Jason:** Is has the new patient stuff changed if you click that button to go down that rabbit hole?  
**Trevor:** let's  
**Jason:** Because I'm just trying I made notes on some pages and I just want to if you didn't update anything there,  
**Trevor:** see.  
**Jason:** it's good. Oh, here we go. This is new.  
**Trevor:** So go ahead and read this real quick.  
   
 

### **00:43:18** {#00:43:18}

   
**Jason:** Oh, cool. And is this like a kind of a clinical  
**Trevor:** Well,  
**Jason:** level?  
**Trevor:** that's what I realized when I was doing this. I was like, I mean, the religious, they're not taking blood pressures and monitoring vitals during the session. They're meditating and, you know, they're doing ohms and stuff. So, what I did here is I gave people the option to choose the features that they want. Um, so on the left,  
**Jason:** Okay,  
**Trevor:** it's the full meal deal. ceremonial is for like bridger and then here if they want  
**Jason:** cool.  
**Trevor:** they can customize it. They just  
**Jason:** Oh, cool. That's sexy.  
**Trevor:** pick.  
**Jason:** or if they have like if I'm if I'm one of Bridger's clients, right, and I log into his front page, it would pull up the you go to the singularism site because it's already it's already clinicized, I guess, is the words.  
   
 

### **00:44:08**

   
**Jason:** Okay, I can see I see the potential. I like it.  
**Trevor:** This just gives people the to to make the workflow easier.  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** If they're not tracking vitals, they just uncheck it.  
**Jason:** Right. Right.  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** Okay. Cool.  
**Trevor:** and this gives them all the different things.  
**Jason:** Yeah,  
**Trevor:** And it's kind of a fun like here's what to expect.  
**Jason:** that's fun. That's fun.  
**Trevor:** Here's all the things you're going to get.  
**Jason:** Yeah. Awesome.  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** Awesome. Because this would be great for which which are you doing depression? Are you doing f\*\*\*\*\*\* PTSD? Are you doing the PHQ9s? You using the GAD 7s?  
   
 

### **00:44:39**

   
**Jason:** Like exactly like this as well, right? You just go through and pop done.  
**Trevor:** Exactly. Right.  
**Jason:** That's perfect.  
**Trevor:** You just mentioned it right there.  
**Jason:** Yep. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah.  
**Trevor:** So, All right.  
**Jason:** But that we're going to be expanding those.  
**Trevor:** Well,  
**Jason:** There's a lot more than just those two, right? So, we have already talked about that  
**Trevor:** yep. And that's the the beautiful thing is,  
**Jason:** though.  
**Trevor:** the way I set it up is we can add we can expand to anything.  
**Jason:** Yeah,  
**Trevor:** okay.  
**Jason:** I love it. It's good,  
**Trevor:** So,  
**Jason:** man.  
**Trevor:** I'll just keep it on clinical because it's everything. And then I'm going to uncheck this.  
   
 

### **00:45:08** {#00:45:08}

   
**Trevor:** Okay. Okay, so this is that first screen that the phase one and it I think it's a much more logical flow. There's four steps. You got to go through the first one and it'll unlock, but you it'll actually put them through all four at the same time. So they'll go through the first series if they want and all three of these will be done.  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** They'll all be marked completed. So I'll walk you through it.  
**Jason:** And this the stuff at the top.  
**Trevor:** So you hit  
**Jason:** Sorry. The stuff at the top that's showing where did that come from now that the age 34 gender. Where did that pull from?  
**Trevor:** Oh, this is the patient that I'm in. and let  
**Jason:** Oh. Oh. Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha.  
**Trevor:** me  
   
 

### **00:45:46**

   
**Jason:** Okay, that's fine. Carry on. I just didn't I didn't know how that got sent there. I thought we did a new one. Okay.  
**Trevor:** no I had so actually I want to hit existing patient and I'm going to  
**Jason:** Okay. I'll I'll run through both.  
**Trevor:** do let's  
**Jason:** This is good. Yeah, I'll I'll I'll go.  
**Trevor:** Oh,  
**Jason:** This is Yeah, these are these are significant changes which I really like because a lot of the stuff you already did. I was like, can we how do how do we not scroll as much? Boom. You already did it. How do we get some of these other things captured? You already did it. So, I'll I'll go back through with my notes and and re-update everything.  
   
 

### **00:46:19**

   
**Jason:** But this this looks this is a lot sexier. It it feels like we're honing in on what we're try the what we're trying to enable and it's getting sharper. So, good  
**Trevor:** Yeah. Okay, let me get this out of here. Um,  
**Jason:** job.  
**Trevor:** so all right, let's do we'll go back to here. So, um, this is I'm I'm basically picking up where we left off the other day. So, here's here's what happens with you.  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** You click this and if if they're on desktop, it'll look like this. But I presumed a lot of people would be on tablet. So, let me um  
**Jason:** I can tell already I agree with you that we need to get we need to get some time with Dr. Allen. I'll try to schedule it for this week. It it's definitely ready to now we're able to walk through the use cases.  
   
 

### **00:47:15** {#00:47:15}

   
**Jason:** It's getting much more refined and that's really the the key with these folks and what he was want to see. So yeah, I I agree. We're there. I I can see it now and I'm already can tell the logic is coming along.  
**Trevor:** So, I'll just I'll keep it here. Is that Can you see that?  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** Okay. Or is it better with All right.  
**Jason:** Yes,  
**Trevor:** So, they go in this is step one,  
**Jason:** sir.  
**Trevor:** right? Informed consent. Got to do it. they click that and boom. this this has been made.  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** then they can go and they can add additional consent forms that they've t taken. they can go back, they can save here and that step will be done or it'll just go next to the the next step.  
   
 

### **00:47:54** {#00:47:54}

   
**Jason:** Excellent. Before it didn't do Excellent.  
**Trevor:** Um  
**Jason:** Yeah, we don't have to close the the the table or what. Perfect. Perfect. I like this.  
**Trevor:** so then here they can you know it's automatically timestamped for today. They can pick their their various levels of this score and we'll just pick a couple of these and this is all pre prior to treatment. So, you know, did you have you know like anything happening, you know, what happened? so they can add sort of like what led up to this. So this this might fall under some of your pre-screening.  
**Jason:** that what or this would this is exactly the area I was in the safety check where where it  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** took all the the bio you know the demographic information but they start entering this and these little warnings come up and it would be like well here's some protocols or some people you could call to talk about this you like a referral type thing.  
   
 

### **00:48:49**

   
**Jason:** This was the messaging. This is one of those intersect points. I'm just flagging it for brain share, but you go in and do the safety check and it says,  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** "Oh, talk to so and so that just went through this with your exact stuff or maybe later, but you know what I mean? How' they handle it?" And then a phone call happens or an email and that's the  
**Trevor:** Yeah. And you know,  
**Jason:** network.  
**Trevor:** sometimes from a technology standpoint that sounds nice, but like you got to separate those things, but but most of that stuff is if it's just a matter of like click through to go see the other protocols and here's like like we can add that in. that  
**Jason:** Yeah, just an idea at this point and we ask the users, right? Because you could,  
**Trevor:** Yes.  
**Jason:** to your point, it could say, "Oh, wait a minute. Dr.  
   
 

### **00:49:33** {#00:49:33}

   
**Jason:** So and so had this." And this could be that functionality could be peppered throughout the whole process. The safety check at the beginning is one. I can think of when you're doing the, you know, starting the session and you do your first vitals check or whatever, if something pops up and then you could exit to a separate thing that says it goes to our doctor network list and says here's the folks that have had similar experiences and then gives them a reachout option. But it there's many points even in the post treatment follow-up would be another point where it's like hey here are some making that information available to them in the network that's pepper those throughout and some capability to do that I think will be very smiled upon that's what they've been that's what's missing today is exactly that okay cool I like  
**Trevor:** Yeah. Yeah. And and and then when you know that it'll be for just those practitioners that want  
   
 

### **00:50:17**

   
**Jason:** this  
**Trevor:** to advertise that they're doing this and the ones that want to remain anonymous can.  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** all right.  
**Jason:** Yep. Maybe you have to be an MD. Maybe we have a limitation that you have to be a doctor doctor to give medical advice,  
**Trevor:** So,  
**Jason:** right? And who are those folks? That's the  
**Trevor:** great idea. I'm Yeah.  
**Jason:** list.  
**Trevor:** And then like some of that stuff. It's just we got to I want to be what I wanted to do is out of the gate. I didn't want to have put this in front of like John and have him say, "You can't do that. You're giving medical advice. This won't work. You know, go back to the drawing board." So, I really tried to be intentional about it. All right.  
   
 

### **00:50:55** {#00:50:55}

   
**Trevor:** Let's just I'm just adding a couple things here. We say we'll follow up. So, this was, you know, kind of all of that safety check part of treatment. Save and continue.  
**Jason:** Much better.  
**Trevor:** Advances.  
**Jason:** Yes, I like  
**Trevor:** here are all of the four.  
**Jason:** that.  
**Trevor:** they can enter any or none. It's totally up to them, you know.  
**Jason:** Do so the the psycho the psychometric scores. So that's what? Anxiety and depression. So these will just expand once we get once we get our our full list. Okay, that's good. Um, yeah, I like this. Okay, so this is Yeah, the screening, the initial sit down. Yeah, it looks good, man.  
**Trevor:** All right. And then, you know, they can, this was something Sarah talked about, you know, does do they what are what are they feeling like?  
   
 

### **00:51:44**

   
**Jason:** Mhm.  
**Trevor:** And then if they wanted to put in vitals, you know, we can you know, blood pressure,  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** put it in and then go.  
**Jason:** Cool. Cool.  
**Trevor:** And then this is oh that's redundant. Hold on. okay. So that clinical observations like yeah they've got high expectations. and and then boom they're  
**Jason:** They want to see dragons. I love it. Okay.  
**Trevor:** done. All four are complete.  
**Jason:** Much smoother,  
**Trevor:** All of those Yeah.  
**Jason:** bro. Much smoother.  
**Trevor:** All these can be exported and they it runs a risk elig eligibility check to make sure that the practitioner isn't putting themselves in sort of any liability. and that we you know they've we've set up all these standards that they have met and then they can export the PDF.  
   
 

### **00:52:48** {#00:52:48}

   
**Trevor:** This down here is is a placeholder if we want to put in any sort of like visualizations.  
**Jason:** Oh, cool.  
**Trevor:** so but boom complete all four stages are complete of phase one.  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** They go down they can see see it and they go to phase two. Boom. Right away I had lithium and in this one it's a psilocybin. Oh, this is this is cuz it's pre preloaded with psilocybin in there.  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** But you'll notice like the MEQ30 is up here and that is something that they can pop  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** into anytime. It's 100 questions. So I didn't want to put it in the workflow. but let's just say that like that they get that warning. the psilocybin was in there. That's just that was to show you. But they clicked on the first box,  
**Jason:** No.  
**Trevor:** you know, I just putting in some you know all all that  
   
 

### **00:53:43** {#00:53:43}

   
**Jason:** No.  
**Trevor:** like and then so  
**Jason:** Yep. What are the measurements on the right? The milligrams.  
**Trevor:** here's  
**Jason:** You got milligrams. That's the default. What else do you have? Gram. Oh, perfect. Okay. Drops. There you go.  
**Trevor:** this is what you were asking about the batch.  
**Jason:** Perfect.  
**Trevor:** So I just have it grayed out for now. but there's a whole other module down below it like a  
**Jason:** Yeah, you nailed it. That's exactly it.  
**Trevor:** So then save that.  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** And now that, you know, indication comes up like, "Hey, hey, heads up. You know,  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** you've got a safety issue here.  
   
 

### **00:54:13** {#00:54:13}

   
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** You may want to go stop and check." Um, but we should be able to Thank you.  
**Jason:** This is way smoother, doo. That's nice.  
**Trevor:** All right. So So now they say,  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** "All right, we're going to go in and we're going into that we're going to start the session. We're going to take vitals." And what I did was some quick entries. So instead of filling all these out, they can just go, "Oh yeah, they're at baseline." And it autopopulates and they can go check, you know,  
**Jason:** Is there a point before this on the old system? There was a point before this where where it was a new session and it said load  
**Trevor:** and  
**Jason:** previous load stuff you wouldn't have. So is this this is that still that logic still in there? Do you know?  
   
 

### **00:54:54** {#00:54:54}

   
**Jason:** It was one of my notes.  
**Trevor:** it's it's in there, but we we're not making them click anymore.  
**Jason:** So I'm just asking Okay.  
**Trevor:** Now it just autopopulates.  
**Jason:** Okay. Cool. Cool. Okay. Cool.  
**Trevor:** So all of the patients existing information will preload for them. So they don't have to re-enter anything.  
**Jason:** H  
**Trevor:** so this can you know this can go in and they can update any of this stuff. respiratory rate temperature. the dietalysis is the sweating scale. Dr. Allen mentioned this in our meeting.  
**Jason:** and the jaw clenching he there's several of them that he  
**Trevor:** yeah yep yep.  
**Jason:** does.  
**Trevor:** So, we can put those in really easily and all that stuff can go in here.  
**Jason:** Perfect.  
**Trevor:** So, we'll say no.  
   
 

### **00:55:32** {#00:55:32}

   
**Trevor:** Um, everything is fully awake. Uh, it'll auto time stamp. If you want to add another reading, um, let's say, you know, things got delayed and then you want to do it again, you just click add another reading, you do the whole thing again. And these are  
**Jason:** So let me ask you a question. You're in the session where this is the in the session use case.  
**Trevor:** Yeah,  
**Jason:** So you're in the session or you set them up. You did the baseline and then you're during the session you this is where you come in.  
**Trevor:** we haven't started the session  
**Jason:** Okay. Okay.  
**Trevor:** yet.  
**Jason:** So this at this add another reading is still it's like you could have multiple beginning points is what this is  
**Trevor:** It Well,  
**Jason:** for.  
**Trevor:** this is the same screen you're going to come back to every time you want to enter the vitals.  
   
 

### **00:56:12** {#00:56:12}

   
**Trevor:** So, if let's say something changes.  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** So this is this is going to timestamp all of this information and whatever else the  
**Jason:** Okay. I understand now. I got it.  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** And then save. Okay.  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** So it's in there now. Start the dosing session. Okay. So you go in there and boom, the clock starts and now the practitioner is hanging out. and then let's say the patient needs comfort.  
**Jason:** Okay,  
**Trevor:** they can hit a rescue protocol and come in and do verbal reassurance what have you and we started it or they go in there, they give their verbal reassurance,  
**Jason:** cool.  
**Trevor:** they they and they it can end it or it can be ongoing  
**Jason:** Yep,  
**Trevor:** and it timestamps it.  
**Jason:** sure.  
   
 

### **00:57:01** {#00:57:01}

   
**Trevor:** Save and continue goes back to the session. You'll notice this this clock no matter at the clock at the top it no matter where you are it shows um  
**Jason:** Can I ask a question? So, we've got go up a little bit. So, I see I it it feels like there should be and you'll educate me in a sec, but you got log or rescue protocol. Isn't there if this is where they're in and the session's running, wouldn't there be a a button first that's not emergency or turning it off? It's really more of a just an update just you know a timed up our number one update or something like what and then if something goes wrong you do rescue protocol or you do adverse but just like nor everything's it's a happy path everything's running great. How do you do updates that  
**Trevor:** So, what we'll do is,  
**Jason:** way?  
   
 

### **00:57:46** {#00:57:46}

   
**Trevor:** and that's why you'll notice that this this screen has a lot of room,  
**Jason:** Uhhuh.  
**Trevor:** is whatever the the doctors want to add,  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** um, we will preload drop-own boxes. So, they can just go click click and and add it like  
**Jason:** And that's I think we should have that as as part of our presentation if that's something that's easy to do. I think we can assume that here you're doctor sitting your session and you click update and it go takes you to the update screen. We should that's basic. We should have that in there and then the rescue and then the the adverse  
**Trevor:** So the that is something I'm saving because two things. One, we can't can't let them write notes. They can't actually type, but but I've got a solution for that,  
**Jason:** the drop downs.  
**Trevor:** which is cool.  
**Jason:** I know.  
   
 

### **00:58:30**

   
**Trevor:** And no,  
**Jason:** I know.  
**Trevor:** not just that, but they will be able to type notes in and it it's there's I put it in the back  
**Jason:** Oh.  
**Trevor:** end. It's a it's a basically like a predictive analysis of the stuff they type in and it'll pull up all of the choices like so so what I but what I want  
**Jason:** Oh, okay. But still, they should have to be able to do that during a session.  
**Trevor:** to  
**Jason:** They should have to do some update that's not a rescue or a adverse reaction as I guess I'm  
**Trevor:** exactly and that's that's my point is that's for this screen and it's it's called it's it's  
**Jason:** saying. Okay.  
**Trevor:** basically meant to be a this is going to be a a positive and this is a crisis.  
**Jason:** And one should just be an update which will it it'll come up.  
   
 

### **00:59:09** {#00:59:09}

   
**Trevor:** Okay,  
**Jason:** We can talk to it. No big deal. Got  
**Trevor:** both of them will have note fields at the bottom.  
**Jason:** it.  
**Trevor:** So that's what this is right here, the session log. It's already built into this one. Um, so you'll you'll be able to to log your notes. I've already got some of them in here.  
**Jason:** Let me let me make So So if I'm in the session monitoring and I just  
**Trevor:** You see this?  
**Jason:** recorded my baseline and they're cruising along and I just have to, you know, it's hour one, I'm doing my hour one check-in and I want to update BP and stuff like that or or anything else, what how do I do that?  
**Trevor:** the same way like so it's these three screens. if they want to enter vitals they can enter vitals.  
**Jason:** Okay.  
**Trevor:** If they want to enter kind of  
   
 

### **00:59:57** {#00:59:57}

   
**Jason:** Like dosed him again. What if they do him again? They do that all the time. Hour  
**Trevor:** yeah same thing go back and  
**Jason:** two.  
**Trevor:** and change the dosing.  
**Jason:** How do I do that?  
**Trevor:** So amend go back into amend more syllus.  
**Jason:** Men. Well, is this then the first one was timestamped already,  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** right?  
**Trevor:** Yep.  
**Jason:** So, this will be hour two,  
**Trevor:** So  
**Jason:** hour two update and then save that. It will now have two dosing protocols in  
**Trevor:** yep.  
**Jason:** there.  
**Trevor:** So see how it's still running. So that dose was entered at the time stamp.  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** Every change that they make, every entry that they make, it just gets added to the log.  
   
 

### **01:00:38** {#01:00:38}

   
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** So they go in and and no matter what,  
**Jason:** Run.  
**Trevor:** as long as long as the time timer is running, it's getting logged.  
**Jason:** Cool. As a separate as a separate data point.  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** I like it. Cool.  
**Trevor:** so here's  
**Jason:** Yeah, because that's what they'll want to do is hour two.  
**Trevor:** another  
**Jason:** I up the dosing and I gave them a shot of heroin. You know what I mean? I they they go in there and and then they go back through and they can someone can print it out or look at it. Love it. It's great.  
**Trevor:** It's right now it's not populating in here because but that's you know so all of this.  
**Jason:** We can speak to it.  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
   
 

### **01:01:08** {#01:01:08}

   
**Trevor:** And then once they're done and I actually set up a thing where if if a practitioner let's say a practitioner wanted to give the patient the opportunity to log how they're feeling without talking to the doctor. there's a separate patient screen that they can put on the tablet and give the tablet to  
**Jason:** Oh,  
**Trevor:** have to the patient to just have during the session. Um, and this is  
**Jason:** What?  
**Trevor:** it.  
**Jason:** I need to go take some psilocybin. I'll bring some over. What is this? This is their This is how they're feeling they would put it in there. I kind of like it.  
**Trevor:** It just gave him something to look at like to kind of like calming  
**Jason:** That's a nice touch, man. I can't wait to see what they say. Yeah, that's cool.  
**Trevor:** just to sort of like make the the the treatment and the tracking part of the experience.  
   
 

### **01:02:04** {#01:02:04}

   
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** Like this way the patient knows they can they can go and if they need something to get out of their head or focus on, they can just look at this, you know?  
**Jason:** or or it's a great way like I'm looking at the one where it's the right in the third middle third row down where it's just spinning circles. It's also a communication tool, right? It's like I feel like I'm just kind of spinning right now and it you know so it so it also is a way to communicate and not just distract I think.  
**Trevor:** Yep. And and so it will log same thing. It'll it'll log these as they go.  
**Jason:** Yeah,  
**Trevor:** All right.  
**Jason:** cool.  
**Trevor:** I'll shoot it  
**Jason:** Yeah, I like that. This is much slicker.  
**Trevor:** now.  
**Jason:** Dude, you did a really good job on this.  
   
 

### **01:02:44** {#01:02:44}

   
**Jason:** I'm telling you right now, I already love  
**Trevor:** Oh,  
**Jason:** it.  
**Trevor:** shoot. My exit on that one. Oh, it's still going. Okay. So, there we go.  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** Oh, yeah. It's put me right back in. Good, good. Um, so it didn't it sent me to that those two welcome screens, but other than that it's still working fine.  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** so we've you know we've logged their vitals and then you know session's over end session and now it takes them to the post session assessments. So, quick experience check. And this was something I pulled off of I can't remember. I It might be in the list here. but this was one of the standard questions  
**Jason:** reference Bernette or it says Barrett at all 2015\.  
**Trevor:** set.  
**Jason:** Cool. Cool.  
   
 

### **01:03:38** {#01:03:38}

   
**Jason:** Well, yeah, we'll figure out what they want. And in fact, this might even be something that's practi there's a lot of stuff I think in the in the profile setup where you know they're they're going to want to use of all the anxiety ones for their particular practice. They're going to want to use GAD 7\. Someone else might choose something. So it will have all these little modules that'll probably pop in and these follow-ups are part of that, right? So maybe maybe they've developed their own custom one and we could we could make those sort of selectable I think right. I mean everything else is modular so it would make sense.  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** Okay. Cool.  
**Trevor:** And I already selected these,  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** but if if the practitioner was selecting them themselves and they typed in one, it would auto advance.  
   
 

### **01:04:21** {#01:04:21}

   
**Trevor:** So they could just go one one one or one, five, six, you know, they could just they don't have to hit one enter. They don't even have to mouse click. They could just do numbers if they want and it auto advance.  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** Um, so then this is the next one, the second page of the three where  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** you know I mean like we can't do everything but we can do a lot.  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** And then and then finally kind of you know I'll just do so I'll hit two two two boom and it it fills them out and then complete and then this is an assessment  
**Jason:** Excellent.  
**Trevor:** score that they can choose to share with the patient or not. kind of like, you know,  
**Jason:** Remission likely,  
**Trevor:** and yeah,  
**Jason:** but I like it.  
**Trevor:** we can tweak all this  
**Jason:** Yeah. Yeah.  
   
 

### **01:05:13**

   
**Trevor:** stuff.  
**Jason:** This is where it would depending on if like if this was a GAD seven, it would have a GAD seven score for example on on anxiety, whatever they were treating initially. Ah, dude, this is much improved.  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** I I Yeah, I like how you I like how you streamlined this. It's so much cleaner now and so much like the double the submit and close the close window. Anyway, it's it's great. I cannot wait to get for folks to get feedback on it. Um, so yeah, definitely ready to go. I I think this is good. And then the the only difference can you go to the start a new session  
**Trevor:** Hold on.  
**Jason:** one.  
**Trevor:** Let me get through the Let's get through the whole workflow. So, we just finished the session.  
**Jason:** Oh.  
   
 

### **01:05:54** {#01:05:54}

   
**Trevor:** So,  
**Jason:** Oh,  
**Trevor:** now I hit the That's okay.  
**Jason:** my  
**Trevor:** I hit that finish.  
**Jason:** bad.  
**Trevor:** And this is that now what they'll do is they'll be able to see and we can customize the heck out of these. But this is the what I called phase three, which is the integration. So like what happened to your your various scores? and this would be over a series of treatments like this is the integrating this most treat in this the most recent session with their whole  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** series.  
**Jason:** That's that's brilliant. Yep. Perfect. That's exactly what we want.  
**Trevor:** Yeah. So you know experience death uh  
**Jason:** Cool. You know what'll be interesting?  
**Trevor:** what's  
**Jason:** I'm going to log this as a future capability, but ultimately the system within scope it should be able to send out we we should be able to configure to where it sends an email to the to the patient just with the questionnaire updates, right?  
   
 

### **01:06:51** {#01:06:51}

   
**Jason:** So some of so they they get to fill it out po posttop week one a message goes out for so and so so the  
**Trevor:** What's right  
**Jason:** clinician doesn't even have to do it. Let's see progress. No, but where they get an email,  
**Trevor:** here?  
**Jason:** they they select and then submit their choices and it updates their table is, you know what I mean? Like the system says, "Oh, we need an update." They send it they send it out to the client, gets an email. Please select answer these questions. Then it goes back in and populates this.  
**Trevor:** Yes. In fact, I did that with the MEQ as well.  
**Jason:** Okay,  
**Trevor:** Um, but it's one of the concepts,  
**Jason:** cool.  
**Trevor:** it's not live, but it's built in already is basically a patient portal.  
   
 

### **01:07:27** {#01:07:27}

   
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** So the the the practitioner can send all of the whatever forms or anything that they want the patient to fill out. if if the patient is open to doing it but in advance or in the lobby, you know, the waiting room, they can they can give a patiently screen to let the patient fill stuff out and that can be used in in between sessions because this is designed to be an ongoing treatment over weeks or months.  
**Jason:** right?  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** So, some capability that that would be automatic from the system where the patient would then get involved and then say, "Doctor, call me. I'm having a relapse." and it would trigger the an email to the practitioner and be like,  
**Trevor:** That's  
**Jason:** "Oh s\*\*\*, I need to call Tony." So stuff like that, right? That's the interaction part.  
**Trevor:** a great idea. Um, I didn't have that in here, but I like that idea.  
   
 

### **01:08:19**

   
**Jason:** Okay,  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** I'll just put it in the scope notes, but that would be cool, right?  
**Trevor:** but this is this is kind of what you're saying because this allows for check-ins  
**Jason:** Where it just every two weeks  
**Trevor:** along the way. So, hey, you know, and and this can I think this might be part of the patient thing. So patient is like, "Oh, I'm just feeling okay." You know, and they can they can check it in and and so the patient could potentially use the patient portal to do a check-in every day and  
**Jason:** Yeah. Whatever the whatever is valuable from their practitioners, they'll tell us. This is great.  
**Trevor:** Exactly.  
**Jason:** This is a good example.  
**Trevor:** Yeah. And so this will allow them to to track the patient  
**Jason:** Perfect.  
**Trevor:** even in between sessions.  
**Jason:** Yeah, it's brilliant.  
   
 

### **01:09:00**

   
**Jason:** Where do you want to retire to? Is it Selena or are we going somewhere else?  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** Yeah, good stuff,  
**Trevor:** so I I'm really happy with this that like it's still connected to dummy data.  
**Jason:** bud.  
**Trevor:** I'm I'm I didn't want to go live on that and have it mess up before I walked you through this,  
**Jason:** Okay,  
**Trevor:** but that Thank you.  
**Jason:** that's sexy.  
**Trevor:** Thank you. I'm super happy with this. This is this is I was telling my friend this is the the most complex puzzle I've ever worked on.  
**Jason:** Ah,  
**Trevor:** So, we got some of this other stuff in here like neuroplasticity.  
**Jason:** say  
**Trevor:** Um, I mean, and there is more that I hadn't put in here. I could have overdone it, but I I decided we needed to stop and get it in front of Dr. Allen first.  
   
 

### **01:09:46** {#01:09:46}

   
**Jason:** yeah. Yeah, I think this first part is is Yeah,  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** it's good to go for sure. I mean there's no sense in he he likes it peace meal anyway but we could we could cover you could cover sit most familiar and I'll take notes but but walking him through this and just having the kind of dialogue I had kind of felt like it was him in a way or some of the other practitioners this is ready to go for that 100%.  
**Trevor:** So, you asked if I could go back to the beginning. Um, were you talking about this  
**Jason:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Trevor:** beginning?  
**Jason:** So, go back to my let's do a new protocol to create new Okay. Yep. New. do clinical protocol. Yep. That's kind of fun.  
   
 

### **01:10:32**

   
**Jason:** Okay. go to let's see there was a So, see how it says it's prepopulated with age 34 years. It's still it's still pulling for something just to notice. But also when I'm creating a new one, the first thing I want to do is what am I trying to treat, right? and I don't I wanted to know where that is. And then there was a safety thing that I was checking. Do the safety check.  
**Trevor:** Yeah, you're exactly right. the that's pre-populated and it it should not be it should  
**Jason:** So, right.  
**Trevor:** be oh you know that I must have fallen out of the  
**Jason:** That's what I noticed on mine.  
**Trevor:** workflow.  
**Jason:** Yeah. No worries. But yeah, one of the first questions should be,  
**Trevor:** Um  
   
 

### **01:11:12** {#01:11:12}

   
**Jason:** are you treating PTSD? Because that will d guide us to which which assessment scores we're  
**Trevor:** 100% you're right.  
**Jason:** using.  
**Trevor:** and some it just got mixed up. I think it got pushed back to the dosing session which shouldn't have been. but you're right that's the the main thing is like why are you here?  
**Jason:** Right.  
**Trevor:** That should be one of the very first things. So they get consent and then the next thing should be why are you like what are we treating for? But I I think it might you might be right like it should probably be even before this because that wouldn't this wouldn't populate without  
**Jason:** Right there you go.  
**Trevor:** that.  
**Jason:** That's wherever that demographic info  
**Trevor:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Jason:** goes.  
**Trevor:** Um, okay. It slipped through. This is perfect. Good, good feedback.  
   
 

### **01:11:56** {#01:11:56}

   
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** Yep.  
**Trevor:** okay.  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** So,  
**Jason:** And that's the only So that's the other one was not the other one was like it but different, but we just covered everything that I noticed before. That's why I wanted to come back to this. So it's it's good. And the other familiar ones I'm familiar with. So yeah, dude.  
**Trevor:** Okay.  
**Jason:** I 100% this protocol, this new protocol is a new journey. Like I'd like to get his focus on just creating a new patient thing. Like if we could do a session of a new patient and then come back and then we'll do well what now now the patient you created. Let's have another session of this is how you edit or modify for follow-up care and stuff like that. And just do those two things new patient and then that patient as a follow-up patient and get his feedback is my thinking because I think it's ready to go for that.  
   
 

### **01:12:39** {#01:12:39}

   
**Trevor:** I agree. Um, and everything you just said is pretty much already in here,  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** like as far as the logic goes. So, it's just going to be a couple tweaks. And just off the top of your head, do you think so we should probably enter a when we click new patient before it goes to this screen, we should be putting in that very first screen as soon as they say, "Hey, we're we're putting in new patient." We should be putting in certain things like what are we treating them for? PTSD. what what else would you like to see in that openings?  
**Jason:** Yep. Well, the age, the gender, all the stuff at the top for sure. Um, I think this is where you start getting into wanting to get feedback on do we start asking their prior experiences, you know, or is that come in the safety check is or is this part here? I don't know.  
   
 

### **01:13:33**

   
**Jason:** I mean, I'll this is where the the other thing that will come in here to answer your question is the screening type information. That's why I want to make sure we are clear with our with our scoping statement. But years they're what they're here for. I think if you're a practitioner, you have you have also which which which do I want to use a a GAD 7 or you you would then either at the individual level select the assessment forms you want loaded that you'll be asking questions on for scoring and and referencing the data. That should be there as well. Like here's the person And then how what do which kind of protocol structure are we going to put them in? Oh, it's PTSD. Great. I want to select this one here. But or it's done at the practitioner level as a profile in your settings.  
   
 

### **01:14:22**

   
**Jason:** Maybe you only do psilocybin like Bridger. They only do psilocybin. So his could just be a default to psilocybin and then he would just select PTSD or anxiety or spiritual thing. But I think I would maybe just have those three things initially just to keep it clean. We can build on it and not make it too muddy. Just my  
**Trevor:** I great input.  
**Jason:** thought.  
**Trevor:** Thank you. Yeah. we'll get that in today.  
**Jason:** Oh, cool. Yeah. And I think that Yeah,  
**Trevor:** So So um  
**Jason:** that  
**Trevor:** what anything else that you can think of?  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** I would say, you know, reach I I didn't want to like do anything in terms of like like a time frame, but if you said, "Hey, we're going to demo this to him tonight." I'd be fine with  
   
 

### **01:15:05** {#01:15:05}

   
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** that.  
**Jason:** I'm I'm gonna I'm going to get off the phone and give him a call here in a few minutes and basically I'm going to try to get two  
**Trevor:** Okay.  
**Jason:** 40 minute sessions, but at least one this week and tomorrow I can't. But Wednesday, I'll just ask him. he seems to be able to set aside his mornings. I can't even tell you how much he has going on. So the simple fact he's entertaining us is this just that's his that's him as a dude, man.  
**Trevor:** Perfect.  
**Jason:** He's just his things are burning around him, it seems. But he's here for us. So, I just want to we're really grateful and I want to be real respectful. And so, when he said, "Just schedule me short stints so I can digest one thing. Let's do the new patient module with him and I'll see how soon I can get it get it scheduled."  
   
 

### **01:15:47**

   
**Jason:** And I will shoot for 12:00 and it would just be the 40-minute session like we did last time. But yeah, let me handle that. I'll I'll get that set up because yeah, this definitely is ready to go. I'd say probably Wednesday. Well, I'd like to be there obviously. So yeah, Wednesday would probably be the earliest, but he's probably I think he's a Thursday, Friday guy usually anyway. So, but I'll find out. I'll take myself out of it.  
**Trevor:** Okay.  
**Jason:** But it's great,  
**Trevor:** Okay.  
**Jason:** dude. I'd really like it.  
**Trevor:** Good. I'm glad.  
**Jason:** Yeah, this is this is much improved from what I saw the other day.  
**Trevor:** Um,  
**Jason:** Like you've done a great job. Like a lot. Like I have almost zero applicable questions originally from these sections.  
   
 

### **01:16:21** {#01:16:21}

   
**Jason:** Now they're now it's there.  
**Trevor:** sweet. Um, okay. So, do you want to move on to any other topics like  
**Jason:** Let's do let's see we go to substance  
**Trevor:** um  
**Jason:** library.  
**Trevor:** Oh, yeah. This is new.  
**Jason:** Oh okay.  
**Trevor:** You'll like this.  
**Jason:** Yeah that this one always gets nice little updates.  
**Trevor:** So,  
**Jason:** So yeah let's now this one is receptive affinity profile that is for ser pilocybin or  
**Trevor:** Oh.  
**Jason:** serotonin because  
**Trevor:** Uh, I selected ketamine. Let's do you have a preference?  
**Jason:** each well select one that's so we did ketamine and this these are these aren't ch let's see D2 the go around so NMDA HT2A okay now select something different than those the the the affinity profile should be changing and I don't think it is.  
**Trevor:** Uh, it's not changing on your screen.  
   
 

### **01:17:24**

   
**Jason:** Well, so we have 5H2A here. I'll show Let's see. Yeah, here. Move your mouse for a sec. I'll show you what I'm talking about. Which one are we on right now?  
**Trevor:** 5H2A.  
**Jason:** Right. Right. Just move your move your cursor off this spiderwe. Okay. Which which chemical are we on?  
**Trevor:** The the white one is pointing at 5H2A.  
**Jason:** I know. Go. Will you scroll up? Oh,  
**Trevor:** Oh,  
**Jason:** we're on psilocybin. Okay.  
**Trevor:** yeah.  
**Jason:** Now go to go to MDMA. Okay. Now go down. See what I'm saying is see how NMDA orert see how the the points on the spider graph those are not the same for MDMA as they are  
   
 

### **01:18:11** {#01:18:11}

   
**Trevor:** should change.  
**Jason:** each receptor is different and I put that in my notes that each one has to be mapped properly so LSD is different it's very few you know psilocybin is different than MDMA is different all these receptor points what they what they bind to are different per substance and we need to update  
**Trevor:** Okay. Yeah,  
**Jason:** those  
**Trevor:** I think that just I think this might be still be pulling from static data. It's No,  
**Jason:** probably.  
**Trevor:** it's I'll double check on that,  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** but that's good feedback.  
**Jason:** Yeah. Because this is this is the stuff where you start seeing and ultimately I'm hoping why this is so sexy  
**Trevor:** Um  
**Jason:** is because when folks start saying, you know, I'm going off from doing research and I have a person who's, you know, has anxiety and I'm looking at I want to be able to compare all the substances because the 5H2A, for example, may is just my mood.  
   
 

### **01:19:06** {#01:19:06}

   
**Jason:** And there might be many different ways for me to treat that mood if that's the receptor I'm targeting. And so it ultimately it kind of can become this you're just presenting data and they're like wait a minute I could try a little bit I could try this instead and lo and behold a completely different genus of psychedelic mushroom nails it because it's more potent. That's that's where this gets really cool is when you're starting to address one thing and you have 10 different ways to do it.  
**Trevor:** And you you bring up a good point. there are a couple other things I already built that com do a receptor comparison. Um  
**Jason:** Cool.  
**Trevor:** so  
**Jason:** That might be a question for Dr. Allen, but I know if I'm presented with this science,  
**Trevor:** let me  
**Jason:** dude, I would be like, I'm after D2, receptor D2. What's the best thing for that?  
   
 

### **01:19:58**

   
**Jason:** And that I'm just going to ask that question. That's what I'm googling. And then it's giving me options.  
**Trevor:** Oh, okay. What's the Okay, got it. So, you want to target certain receptors and you want to see what is the best protocol or substance  
**Jason:** Maybe because a D2 receptor is for mood enhancing like that.  
**Trevor:** or  
**Jason:** So they know that receptor if it's triggered it makes you happier. The other one might be makes you calm. Maybe the NMDA receptor makes you calm. And I'm going, man, this person's freaking the f\*\*\* out. Which receptor is that for each one of these substances? And I go, "Oh, shoot. They need a little Molly." That's how Dr. Allen works, right? He knows the chemicals and receptors he's after and then he targets it with his treatments.  
   
 

### **01:20:43** {#01:20:43}

   
**Jason:** That's advanced level stuff. And if we're not only sharing it, but then have the results of it. It really the learning curve get this whole thing in my mind is steepen that f\*\*\*\*\*\* learning curve for everybody. They're discombobulated. So we want them to be efficient, learn fast, share info, and talk. And if we can do that with this proven stuff, I it it's literally going to change the world, man. Because nobody does those associations. They do it under regulatory bodies. Well, this is approved. f\*\*\* that, man. We're helping people. We're You can Google this, but here it is in a nice format. Knock yourself out if you dare. But that long term, I think that's where we want to be.  
**Trevor:** I love it.  
   
 

### **01:21:24** {#01:21:24}

   
**Trevor:** Great feedback. Great feedback. Okay.  
**Jason:** No.  
**Trevor:** I I wouldn't be surprised if I'm able to implement a lot of that in the in in very short time. what else?  
**Jason:** Gosh, man. Um, can I let me do this? C, let's pause because I want to we have enough for to go for Here's my thing. We have enough to go for with Dr. Allen. So, let me try to schedule that and then please go off and work, but I want to go back through these with fresh eyes again. I'm I'm seeing things so much clearer and differently based on the layout and it's it's so much easier to communicate with this revision. So, let's let's get on the books. I'll take care of that. Let's go over new protocol and then the next session will be updating existing protocol where we can add some insession stuff and let me start going through these new these new menu items and and see because all my thoughts have changed.  
   
 

### **01:22:13** {#01:22:13}

   
**Jason:** Yeah,  
**Trevor:** Cool.  
**Jason:** good stuff. Good  
**Trevor:** Well, thank you. Um,  
**Jason:** progress.  
**Trevor:** all right. What? So, why don't you just go ahead and talk to Dr. Allen. One thing I'm noticing by looking at this screen is the the hero this main section is it's taking up way too much real estate. Um, so I got to I got to try I had these vert these two things that are stacked vertically are taking up so much room.  
**Jason:** Yeah.  
**Trevor:** I had them horizontal, but I will I'll tighten up this hero section so things are laid out horizontally and so it doesn't take up as much real estate. And then more of these scientific Yeah,  
**Jason:** accordion accordion menus.  
**Trevor:** it Yeah,  
**Jason:** Yeah,  
**Trevor:** we could we could do that. for  
**Jason:** I I would that was one of my feedback is there's too much scrolling going  
   
 

### **01:22:55**

   
**Trevor:** sure.  
**Jason:** on, right? And I think people can get overwhelmed if you're not a scientist. I don't need to see what the molecular weight is. So, make that an option for the nerds that want to dig down.  
**Trevor:** Here's  
**Jason:** But, we should be able to fit all this on one screen. I would think and especially on a phone, right? It just gets difficult. So, but this is so much better than the last one. This is much sexier. So, right.  
**Trevor:** how it looks on a phone.  
**Jason:** Look how many Look how it's like 12 pages down. So,  
**Trevor:** Yeah.  
**Jason:** so we Yes,  
**Trevor:** Yeah. Accordion is a great  
**Jason:** they just do that because that'll be consistent format we'll use.  
   
 

### **01:23:30** {#01:23:30}

   
**Trevor:** idea.  
**Jason:** People will in inherently know what to do with it and it will just be part of the site. It'll be a characteristic and it will we'll be able to load more data or more applicable data because you can select. So, yeah.  
**Trevor:** Okay. Um, let me know what Dr. Allen says and I'm going to keep at it. This is I'm having fun and and I agree with you. I think this is going to make have a huge impact on the on the industry. Oh, and also I've got you set up with mobile sharing. So, you will be able to literally just open up your phone and tell somebody to open up their phone and hit and there'll be a QR code like that's kind of like cool like it'll be a branded page with a QR code sort of built in and all they will have to
