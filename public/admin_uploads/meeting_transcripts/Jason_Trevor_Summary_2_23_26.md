### **Summary**

Jason and Trevor discussed recent system updates, including workflow features and resolved an access issue so Jason could upload documents to the shared folder. A significant portion of the meeting focused on defining the project's scope, with Jason stressing the need for clear documentation that identifies the tool as a "post-screening treatment and follow-up logging tool" focused on regulatory compliance, not a full EHS system, while Trevor confirmed the database architecture is designed to prevent PHI collection. They agreed that the immediate next step is for Jason to schedule a demo of the developed tool with Dr. Allen to gather feedback, and Trevor provided a walkthrough of the new, streamlined workflow, which includes features for capturing informed consent, logging timestamped vitals, and a patient-facing experience screen.

### **Details**

* **Recent System Checks and Workflow Features**: Trevor informed Jason that they ran another series of system checks and integrated workflow features to ensure that anyone picking up the project can easily understand the status, as previously discussed ([00:02:20](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.tfqkrfy9z14u)).

* **Need for Scope Alignment and Documentation**: Jason expressed a need for clearer documentation of the project's scope, identifying what the tool is and is not, to improve their understanding ([00:02:20](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.tfqkrfy9z14u)). They suggested documenting exclusions, such as the tool not being an EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) system, and focusing on a core set of 5 to 10 key features ([00:03:08](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.n2c1m3mhi3iy)).

* **Document Access Issues and Resolution**: Jason mentioned they could not upload a document to the shared link because they lacked access, which Trevor quickly resolved by changing the default permission from "commenter" to "editor" ([00:03:08](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.n2c1m3mhi3iy)). Trevor directed Jason to upload the document to the "Jason update Monday 223" file with five tabs ([00:04:05](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.ytwnplei99im)).

* **Document Sharing and Loading Delay**: Jason experienced difficulty uploading their document to the Google platform and ultimately decided to share their screen to review their initial notes first, postponing the document upload ([00:04:55](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.rdyeczbrdohh)).

* **Prioritizing Meeting with Dr. Allen**: Jason initiated a discussion on the order of next steps, suggesting they should meet with Dr. Allen, who has provided information but has not yet seen the developed tool. Trevor agreed that they are ready to show the tool to Dr. Allen, and Jason committed to scheduling this meeting ([00:05:32](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.j8hzznlbq0mv)).

* **Defining In-Scope and Out-of-Scope Functionality**: Jason explained their methodology for scope definition, which involves creating a tracker to clarify what functionality is included and what needs to be placed on the back burner ([00:06:20](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.imva7q9pogs3)). Their initial high-level scope list included identifying what the tool is not, specifically noting it is not an EHS system or a pre-screening tool ([00:06:56](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.dug7pkxrdh4r)).

* **Clarification on EHS System Differences**: Trevor clarified that a typical EHS system handles treatment, billing, insurance, and scheduling, whereas their tool is a stripped-down version focused only on treatment compliance tracking. The tool is designed to allow practitioners to document compliance while maintaining patient and practitioner privacy, avoiding the complexities of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance tied to a full EHS system ([00:07:28](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.8nt5iywlchl4)).

* **Tool Positioning as Post-Screening/Treatment Log**: Jason summarized the tool's current function as a "post-screening treatment and follow-up logging tool". Trevor noted that while the starting point is post-treatment decision, they included some pre-screening features, such as the MEQ30, as previously requested ([00:08:23](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.f0e3dyz7eo7n)).

* **Emphasis on Regulatory Compliance and Networking**: Jason stressed that the tool's core focus is regulatory compliance and building a network of people for interaction and sharing, in addition to treatment logging. Key in-scope features include profiles and a function to pull up information about other practitioners who have managed similar contraindications or safety issues ([00:09:08](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.i325306gyor1)).

* **Protecting Privacy and Avoiding PHI Collection**: Trevor confirmed that the tool excludes billing and the collection of personally identifying information (PII) to maintain regulatory compliance and protect privacy ([00:09:56](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.gz9c74nw4j14)). Trevor mentioned a document called "Why No PHI" that details this approach ([00:10:43](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.9iq9ok373qqd)).

* **Legal and Cost Constraints on Networking Integration**: Trevor explained that integrating social networking directly with the database would introduce HIPAA compliance issues, requiring approximately $4 million for legal fees and registration ([00:12:11](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.2qar2ktiw6mn)). They proposed two solutions for the social networking component: using prepackaged messages or creating a separate, seamless social platform on a different domain (ppnportal.com or .org) ([00:13:02](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.sm7zbq1znfjl)).

* **Architectural Solidity and Compliance of Database**: Trevor stated that the database architecture is designed to make it impossible to collect Personal Health Information (PHI) today or in the future, ensuring it is defensible in court, compliant for insurance, and HIPAA compliant ([00:13:57](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.4gsqumdp2xtl)).

* **Network Functionality and Safety Triggers**: Jason sought clarification on how networking would function when a safety issue, like a conflict or a trigger, arises during a session ([00:14:54](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.t0gmqunoi0kc)). They proposed functionality to quickly view and contact other medical professionals who have experience with those specific triggers ([00:15:43](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.l8od1fwlq6j3)).

* **Proposed Workaround for Networking Links**: Trevor suggested that a link could pop up when a warning is triggered, which would direct the user outside the database to access shared provider information if the providers consented to sharing it ([00:15:43](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.l8od1fwlq6j3)). They cautioned against providing medical advice on the site, as this would require a different, more expensive business model ([00:16:45](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.mr6jo4t8k9eg)).

* **Alignment on Next Steps: Tool Walkthrough and Dr. Allen Feedback**: Trevor suggested doing a walkthrough of the system, which they believe will answer many of Jason's questions, followed by a discussion of any remaining issues ([00:17:32](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.tgywnnihbc2w)). The primary immediate goal is to obtain feedback from Dr. Allen to prevent unnecessary rework before advancing development ([00:18:10](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.2l384ya9x9vj)).

* **Confirmation of Walkthrough Order and Efficiency**: After a minor misunderstanding about the timing of the Dr. Allen meeting, Trevor clarified that they still want to address Jason's questions but prefer to do so while demonstrating the system for efficiency ([00:19:05](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.mggqkg5ikzcy)).

* **Use Case and Tool Intersection in Therapist Process**: Jason asked where Trevor envisions the tool intersecting the therapist's process, post-pre-screen. Trevor confirmed the tool's design focuses on the core treatment tracking, starting from when the patient enters the office and ending when they leave, as defined by Dr. Allen ([00:21:20](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.em76bsfrxmsh)).

* **Tool's Purpose for Tracking and Legal Defensibility**: Trevor reiterated that the tool's function is to give practitioners the ability to track treatment and report on it without violating privacy, supporting them in billing insurance or, in Bridger's case, proving compliance in court ([00:22:20](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.p81xfa3duo8b)).

* **Need for Protocol Templating Functionality**: Jason proposed adding a function to create a template from an existing, successful protocol, enabling practitioners to easily copy baseline data like dosing and treatment focus (e.g., PTSD) to save preparation time ([00:24:13](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.oz0ygetyg08w)) ([00:26:06](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.cwk6nf3r64un)).

* **Protocol Viewing and Data Set Availability**: Trevor confirmed that while the functionality is not yet live, users will be able to look up, view, and print protocols, including the entire data set and statistics, filtered by various factors, but without personally identifiable information ([00:27:44](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.cnw3ar8qbvgk)).

* **Scheduling Demonstration with Dr. Allen**: Jason agreed the tool is ready for review and will schedule a walkthrough/demo session with Dr. Allen by the end of the week to gather preliminary feedback ([00:29:03](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.yj7k6mdz93wc)).

* **Verification of Placeholder Data and Statistics**: Jason flagged discrepancies in practitioner numbers (e.g., 15,000) found on the start page. Trevor confirmed these were dummy data, likely generated by an AI, and stressed a principle of absolute transparency and verified factual representation, with a plan to add citations for statistics ([00:29:41](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.p0xoe16z2pxu)).

* **Removal of Unnecessary Features**: Trevor confirmed they removed the state page that Sarah found unnecessary. Jason acknowledged that most of their remaining questions related to features and order are secondary until the new system is viewed ([00:31:13](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.4pa549urxrkc)).

* **Potency Normalizer and Feature Backlogging**: Jason inquired about the potency normalizer feature, which Trevor confirmed is on the back burner, along with Apple Watch integration and other potential features, which were either removed or hidden for the initial Dr. Allen review ([00:31:51](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.bwm5bqjrnzue)).

* **Strategic Importance of Potency Normalization and Sourcing**: Jason emphasized the huge opportunity the potency normalizer presents for establishing standardized substances, generating potential income streams through advertising/referrals, and addressing a critical missing piece in the industry—standardized sourcing ([00:33:29](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.97sspf501dd8)). They advocated for including substance-specific details (e.g., *cubensis* or *sclerosia*) as additional drop-down options in the selector ([00:34:16](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.tezcofv2og8a)).

* **Networking Value through Aggregated Data**: Trevor agreed on the value of networking, noting that the tool's strength lies in aggregating data to show, for example, that "86% of treatments had a positive outcome with that strain," once practitioner preferences are understood ([00:36:11](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.5bu4tyorn52d)).

* **Branding and Credibility Through Landing Page Design**: Trevor presented the live domain's landing page, which they redid to appear scientific and credible, avoiding excessive mentions of "psychedelic" to maintain search engine visibility and appeal to figures like Dr. Allen ([00:37:38](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.usd2ku79zipy)). The page is designed to appear as a scientific tool that augments intelligence ([00:38:17](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.bvm1k42vrijj)).

* **New Workflow Structure and Customization**: Trevor initiated the walkthrough by showing the new workflow, which begins with a three-phase introduction screen and then allows users to select a new or existing patient ([00:41:28](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.6emp3r67b8r5)). A new feature is the option for users to select their desired features, choosing between "Clinical," "Ceremonial" (for groups like Bridger), or a custom feature list to simplify their workflow ([00:43:18](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.6xp50m973zzr)).

* **Phase One Workflow Steps and Data Capture**: Trevor demonstrated Phase One, which now includes a more logical, four-step flow ([00:45:08](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.3md0njrlda7u)). They showed how informed consent is captured, how psychometric scores (like PHQ9s) are entered, and how safety checks trigger, noting that the logic is becoming sharper and more refined ([00:47:15](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.qw5wicxodni0)).

* **Network Integration Points and Medical Advice**: Jason noted that the safety check page is a perfect intersection point for network functionality, where warnings could trigger links to practitioners with similar experiences ([00:47:54](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.kzsgxvgntk)). Trevor suggested that this functionality could be peppered throughout the process, limited to only those practitioners who explicitly opt-in and potentially to only MDs to avoid providing unauthorized medical advice ([00:49:33](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.86h5p73jv59y)).

* **Completion of Phase One and Transition to Phase Two**: Trevor showed the completion of the four Phase One steps, including clinical observations and vitals entry, noting that all data can be exported and an eligibility check is run. Phase Two immediately displays warnings, such as a contraindication between lithium and psilocybin ([00:50:55](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.nw6dq70l13v)) ([00:52:48](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.rm4s0xbjyaoi)).

* **Dosage and Substance Tracking Improvements**: During Phase Two, Trevor demonstrated the dosage entry, which includes measurements for milligrams, grams, and drops, and confirmed that the batch tracking area is reserved for the future implementation of the potency normalization feature ([00:53:43](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.uds76tzccb6m)).

* **Initial Session Setup and Vitals Entry**: Trevor demonstrated the smoother process for initiating a new session, which now automatically preloads the patient's existing information so they do not have to re-enter anything ([00:54:13](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.lyonp5entvyz)). The new system allows for quick entries of vitals, such as temperature or respiratory rate, and includes scales for jaw clenching and the "dietalysis" or sweating scale, as previously discussed with Dr. Allen. Jason confirmed that the logic for loading previous session data is still present, but the user is no longer required to click a load button as it autopopulates ([00:54:54](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.t559ohhh4xyw)).

* **Multiple Vitals Readings and Session Start**: Trevor clarified that the same screen is used every time they need to enter vitals, even if the session has not officially started, and that there is an option to "add another reading" which auto time stamps the new entry. Jason understood that this screen is designed to log timestamped vitals readings throughout the process, and they can save this information before starting the dosing session ([00:55:32](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.49diojeg9op8)). Once the session begins, a clock starts running, and practitioners can activate a rescue protocol for patient comfort, such as verbal reassurance, which is also timestamped ([00:56:12](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.mhfkzt2gntb7)).

* **In-Session Updates and Logging**: Jason inquired about a standard update button for monitoring a session when everything is proceeding normally, rather than just the rescue protocol or adverse event buttons ([00:57:01](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.9dwuhp94ca10)). Trevor explained they planned to utilize the open space on the screen to preload drop-down boxes for quick logging of notes, while also mentioning a solution for typing notes using a predictive analysis feature ([00:57:46](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.e27qoeyryof)). The current interface includes a session log feature built into the screen for logging notes ([00:59:09](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.sbz0yxd77xoc)).

* **Logging Additional Dosing and Monitoring**: Jason asked how to log subsequent actions like a second dose of medication during a session, which is a common practice at the one or two-hour mark. Trevor confirmed that they would go back into the "amend more syllus" section, and since the timer is running, every change or entry, including amendments to dosing, gets added to the log as a separate timestamped data point ([00:59:57](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.stjjkafova72)). Jason expressed approval for this logging functionality, recognizing its importance for tracking detailed session events ([01:00:38](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.z0jbawoqq54m)).

* **Patient-Facing Experience and Tracking**: Trevor introduced a separate patient screen that can be placed on a tablet during the session, allowing the patient to log how they are feeling without consulting the doctor. This screen, which includes visual elements like spinning circles, serves as both a communication tool for the patient to express feelings and a distraction tool, and it logs their entries as they go ([01:01:08](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.97bvj41r1a1e)). Jason found this feature to be a beneficial and slick addition ([01:02:04](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.8ouozs4qdhtb)).

* **Post-Session Assessment Workflow**: Following the end of the session, the system automatically takes them to post-session assessments, starting with a quick experience check based on standard questions ([01:02:44](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.uny3guazy16e)). The system is designed to allow practitioners to select assessment modules, such as GAD 7, either for their specific practice or to create custom ones ([01:03:38](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.3iba8wshe35m)). The entry of scores is streamlined, allowing users to enter numbers which auto-advance to the next field, concluding with an assessment score that can optionally be shared with the patient ([01:04:21](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.2huilrp5vwjy)).

* **Integration of Treatment Scores**: Trevor demonstrated "phase three," the integration screen, which shows the results of the most recent session integrated with the patient's whole series of treatments over time. Jason deemed this integration feature "brilliant" and exactly what is needed. They also suggested a future capability where the system could automatically send out post-treatment questionnaire updates via email to the patient, with the patient's selection updating their table ([01:05:54](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.1n7b5vk9xd4d)).

* **Patient Portal for Inter-Session Care**: Trevor confirmed that a patient portal concept is already built in, which allows practitioners to send forms for patients to fill out in advance or between sessions, as the treatment is designed to be ongoing ([01:06:51](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.6zzr22nnzn)). Jason proposed an advanced feature where the system could trigger an email alert to the practitioner if a patient uses the portal to report a relapse, allowing for timely follow-up. Trevor confirmed this proposed feature is a great idea ([01:07:27](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.dk8bo7c90xrs)).

* **Reviewing the New Protocol Workflow**: Jason suggested reviewing the creation of a new session and noted that certain demographic information, such as age, was prepopulated when it should not have been ([01:09:46](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.9ejacqfg5oto)). They emphasized that the first step when creating a new protocol should be defining the condition being treated, such as PTSD, as this guides the selection of the appropriate assessment scores. Trevor acknowledged this as perfect and helpful feedback, confirming that the reason for the patient's visit should be one of the very first data points collected ([01:11:12](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.71q19r1obaqp)).

* **Proposal for Future Dr. Allen Demos**: Jason suggested focusing the next demonstration for Dr. Allen on a "new patient" module, followed by a subsequent session focused on editing or modifying that patient for follow-up care ([01:11:56](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.fu2elwcro1th)). When creating a new patient, the initial screens should capture basic demographics and the condition being treated, as well as enabling the practitioner to select which specific assessment forms (e.g., GAD 7\) they want loaded for scoring ([01:12:39](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.1wicoic4p05s)). Jason plans to schedule a 40-minute demo session with Dr. Allen, likely on Wednesday, to cover the new patient module ([01:15:05](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.cpzm93lrzlwh)).

* **Substance Library and Receptor Affinity Profile**: The discussion shifted to the Substance Library, specifically the receptive affinity profile, where Jason noted that the spider graph points were not changing correctly when selecting different substances like MDMA or psilocybin ([01:16:21](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.jp6c3jmdpxs8)). This data needs to be updated so that the receptor binding points are accurately mapped to each substance, which is key for comparing different substances based on targeted receptors. Trevor noted this was likely due to the static data and that they would double-check the implementation ([01:18:11](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.ez3i8yi3xext)).

* **Targeting Receptors for Treatment**: Jason highlighted the importance of being able to target specific receptors, such as D2 for mood enhancing or NMDA for calmness, and then identifying the best substance for that target ([01:19:06](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.yl9zfdtcmedz)). They stressed that this advanced level of association—linking receptors, substances, and treatment outcomes—would significantly "steepen that learning curve" for practitioners and advance the industry ([01:20:43](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.cnsbcsnnn633)). Trevor received this as great feedback and indicated that they might be able to implement much of it quickly, noting that a receptor comparison feature is already built ([01:19:06](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.yl9zfdtcmedz)) ([01:21:24](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.2efnegmbvfc9)).

* **Design Feedback on Substance Library Layout**: Jason requested a design change for the substance library to reduce excessive scrolling, suggesting the use of accordion menus to display the large amount of data, especially for non-scientists. Trevor agreed that the main section was taking up too much real estate and confirmed that an accordion menu would be a great way to tighten up the layout and display data more efficiently, especially on mobile devices ([01:22:13](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.yiqypue7oarj)).

* **Mobile Sharing and Transparency Features**: Trevor mentioned setting up mobile sharing, enabling "two click sharing" via a QR code at conferences to help create viral word of mouth, allowing people to access samples before signing up ([01:23:30](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.rszrhh7s6ag4)). Jason praised the inclusion of study references throughout the site, particularly alongside risk information, as it provides a solid foundation for transparency ([01:24:27](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.hfhwrpnua30r)).

* **Next Steps and Development Commitment**: Jason will try to schedule the demonstration with Dr. Allen for Wednesday, focusing on the new protocol module, and will spend time reviewing the new system updates ([01:25:12](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.eoe05tpgvusv)). Trevor expressed enthusiasm for the potential of the project and offered to implement many of the discussed changes before the Wednesday demo ([01:25:48](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.m40x3nkyfbt9)). They requested that Jason continue to test and report any system issues, such as incorrect button functionality ([01:26:22](?tab=t.5yz1feygve02#heading=h.7y3vdthniyjd)).

### **Suggested next steps**

- [ ] Jason will go back through and re-update his notes with the changes and updates in the system.  
- [ ] Jason and Trevor will schedule a call with Dr. Allen for the end of the week to do a walkthrough and let him demo the product to get his preliminary feedback.  
- [ ] Jason will try to schedule a short 40-minute demo session with Dr. Allen, preferably on Wednesday, to focus on the 'new patient' module.  
- [ ] Trevor will update the in-session screen to include a general update button with pre-loaded drop-down boxes, separate from rescue protocol or adverse reactions.  
- [ ] Trevor will update the new protocol workflow to first capture: (1) what is being treated (e.g., PTSD), (2) demographic info (age and gender), and (3) selected assessment forms (e.g., GAD 7).  
- [ ] Trevor will ensure the affinity profile on the substance library screen updates dynamically based on the selected substance, as the data appears static currently.  
- [ ] Trevor will update the substance library screen to reduce the real estate footprint of the hero section by laying out items horizontally and using accordion menus for scientific data.  
- [ ] Jason will continue testing and make notes of any issues, such as back buttons not working correctly, to provide feedback to Trevor.  
- [ ] Jason will go through the new menu items and update his notes after seeing the revisions.
