# 🗺️ CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAP
## PPN Research Portal - Practitioner Experience

**Created By:** LEAD  
**Date:** 2026-02-12 02:23 PST  
**For:** USER (strategic planning)  
**Context:** VoC research + pre-launch planning

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Purpose:** Map the complete practitioner journey from first awareness to loyal advocate, identifying touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and opportunities at each stage.

**Key Insights:**
- Practitioners buy **solutions to problems**, not features
- **Trust** is the #1 barrier (legal anxiety, data privacy concerns)
- **Time to value** must be < 7 days (or they churn)
- **Network effects** drive retention (benchmarking value increases with users)

**Journey Stages:**
1. **Awareness** - "I have a problem"
2. **Consideration** - "Can this solve my problem?"
3. **Trial** - "Does this actually work?"
4. **Activation** - "I'm getting value"
5. **Retention** - "I can't live without this"
6. **Advocacy** - "Everyone should use this"
