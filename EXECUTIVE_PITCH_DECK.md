## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (Dr. Shena's Voice)

### **"Research progress is hampered by lack of comparable data"**
*— Dr. Shena Jaramillo, Bend Ketamine Clinic*

**The Current Reality:**

- ❌ **No common data collection framework** across clinics
- ❌ **Each practitioner using different assessment tools**
- ❌ **Impossible to compare protocols or outcomes**
- ❌ **No way to identify best practices**
- ❌ **Evidence base remains fragmented**

**Impact:**
- Practitioners making decisions in isolation
- Patients receiving inconsistent care
- Field advancement slowed by 10-20 years
- Legislative change lacks compelling evidence

---

## SLIDE 3: THE PRECEDENT (Dr. Fadiman's Model)

### **Dr. James Fadiman: 17 Years of Anonymous Data Collection**

**What he proved:**
- ✅ Systematic data collection works (microdosing evidence base)
- ✅ Anonymous reporting generates participation
- ✅ Aggregated data drives field forward
- ✅ No institutional backing required

**What he couldn't do:**
- ❌ Real-time feedback to practitioners
- ❌ Comparative effectiveness analysis
- ❌ Protocol optimization at scale
- ❌ Clinical decision support

**Our Opportunity:**  
*"What took Dr. Fadiman 17 years, we can do in 17 months — and give practitioners real-time intelligence."*

---

## SLIDE 4: WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

# **Clinical Intelligence Platform**
## Not an EHR. Not Practice Management. Something New.

### **What It IS:**
✅ Real-time benchmarking network  
✅ Clinical decision support system  
✅ Predictive outcome modeling  
✅ Research infrastructure  
✅ Quality improvement tool  

### **What It's NOT:**
❌ Electronic Health Record (EHR)  
❌ Practice management system  
❌ Patient portal  
❌ Document storage  
❌ PHI repository  

**Strategic Positioning:**  
*"The intersection of clinical utility and research rigor that doesn't exist today."*

```

**Key Innovation:**  
*Inputs simultaneously act as filters on real-time data visualization*

---

## SLIDE 6: THE CLINICAL WORKFLOW TRANSFORMATION

### **BEFORE: Retroactive Logging**
1. Practitioner designs protocol (in isolation)
2. Delivers treatment
3. Logs data weeks later
4. Sees benchmarks months later
5. **Value: Minimal** (too late to inform decisions)

---

### **AFTER: Prospective Intelligence**

**BEFORE Treatment:**
1. Practitioner enters patient profile
2. **System shows:** Similar patients' outcomes (N=127, 68% success)
3. Practitioner enters proposed protocol
4. **System shows:** Receptor targets, safety alerts, network benchmarks
5. Practitioner adjusts protocol based on data
6. **Practitioner shows patient:** "Here's why we're choosing this approach"
7. Saves "planned protocol"

**AFTER Treatment:**
8. Logs actual treatment + outcomes
9. **System compares:** Planned vs Actual
10. **System learns:** Updates predictive models

**Value: Transformative** (every decision informed by network intelligence)

---

## SLIDE 7: THE MOAT (Network Effects)

### **Why This Gets Stronger Over Time**

**Traditional Software:** Value is static  
**Network Platform:** Value compounds with every user

```
Network Size → Data Quality → Predictive Accuracy → Clinical Value → More Users → Repeat

Week 1:   10 sites  →  N=50   →  Low confidence  →  Modest value
Month 6:  50 sites  →  N=500  →  Medium confidence →  High value
Year 2:   150 sites →  N=5000 →  High confidence  →  Indispensable
```

**The Compounding Effect:**
- More practitioners = More data
- More data = Better predictions
- Better predictions = Higher value
- Higher value = More practitioners

**Defensibility:**  
*"First mover advantage in psychedelic benchmarking is a 5-10 year moat"*

---

## SLIDE 8: WHY NO PHI? (Strategic Advantage)

### **This Isn't Caution. It's Strategy.**

| **With PHI (EHR Model)** | **Without PHI (Our Model)** |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| ❌ HIPAA compliance required | ✅ No HIPAA requirements |
| ❌ $500K/year ongoing cost | ✅ $0 compliance overhead |
| ❌ Breach liability: $10M+ | ✅ No breach risk |
| ❌ State-by-state regulations | ✅ Uniform nationwide |
| ❌ Slow innovation (legal review) | ✅ Fast iteration |
| ❌ Cross-site data sharing blocked | ✅ Network benchmarking enabled |
| ❌ Competing with Epic, Cerner | ✅ Blue ocean (no competitors) |

**The Insight:**  
*"Benchmarking doesn't need PHI. Removing PHI removes 90% of our risk and 100% of our regulatory burden."*

**Precedent:**  
- Dr. Fadiman: 17 years, zero PHI, massive impact
- Consumer genomics: 23andMe built $3B company on aggregated, de-identified data

---

## SLIDE 9: THE PRIVACY ARCHITECTURE

### **How We Enable Benchmarking Without PHI**

**What We DON'T Collect:**
- ❌ Names, emails, phone numbers
- ❌ Addresses, dates of birth
- ❌ Medical record numbers
- ❌ Exact dates (year only)
- ❌ Free-text clinical notes

**What We DO Collect:**
- ✅ Age ranges (36-45, not exact age)
- ✅ Structured protocols (substance ID, dose, route)
- ✅ Standardized outcomes (PHQ-9, MEQ-30)
- ✅ Hashed subject IDs (within-site tracking only)
- ✅ Aggregated statistics (N≥10 minimum)

**The Result:**
- Practitioners can track subjects across sessions (hashed ID)
- Network can benchmark outcomes (aggregated data)
- Zero PHI = Zero HIPAA risk

**Technical Implementation:**
- Small-cell suppression enforced in SQL (N≥10)
- No cross-site subject linking
- Safe Harbor compliance by design

---

## SLIDE 10: THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 3,500 interventional mood treatment sites (US)
- $600/site/month average
- **TAM: $25.2M ARR**

**Reality Check:**  
*"This is NOT a billion-dollar SaaS TAM. This is a focused, defensible market."*

---

### **Serviceable Available Market (SAM) - 24 Months**
- 400-800 sites realistically serviceable
- **SAM: $2.9M - $5.8M ARR**

---

### **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) - 24 Months**
- 50-150 paying sites (realistic goal)
- 5-20 multi-site operators (anchor customers)
- **SOM: $360K - $1.1M ARR**

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Free tier: Read-only demo dashboards
- Clinic Basic: $399/site/month (site-only dashboards)
- **Clinic Benchmark: $999/site/month** (network intelligence) ← Our focus
- Enterprise: $2K-$10K/month (multi-site rollups)

**Why $999/month works:**  
*"Clinical decision support is worth 3x more than data entry tools"*

---

## SLIDE 11: GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Q1 2026)**
**Target:** 1-5 "lighthouse" practitioners

- ✅ Dr. Shena Jaramillo (Bend Ketamine Clinic) - Committed
- 🎯 MAPS conference attendees (10,000+ practitioners)
- 🎯 Oregon psilocybin service centers (licensed, data-hungry)
- 🎯 Colorado DORA-approved training cohorts

**Deliverable:** Working demo + 5 case studies

---

### **Phase 2: Network Density (Q2-Q3 2026)**
**Target:** 20-50 sites (critical mass for benchmarking)

**Channels:**
- Training cohorts (built-in user acquisition)
- MAPS/ASKP conference presentations
- Practitioner referrals ("give-to-get" model)
- Content marketing (SEO for "ketamine outcomes tracking")

**Milestone:** N≥10 for most common protocols (benchmarks go live)

---

### **Phase 3: Scale (Q4 2026 - 2027)**
**Target:** 100-150 sites

**Virality Mechanism:**
- Benchmark badges for clinic marketing
- "Your clinic vs network" competitive dynamics
- Training programs require participation
- Insurance/compliance benefits

**Revenue Model:** $999/site/month × 100 sites = **$1.2M ARR**

---

## SLIDE 12: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### **Why Competitors Can't Copy This**

| **Competitor** | **Model** | **Why They Can't Do This** |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Osmind** | EHR for psychedelic therapy | PHI model blocks cross-site benchmarking |
| **Epic/Cerner** | Enterprise EHR | Not psychedelic-specific, no benchmarking |
| **SimplePractice** | Practice management | Not clinical intelligence, no outcomes focus |
| **Academic Research** | Clinical trials | Too slow, not real-time, not practitioner-facing |

**Our Blue Ocean:**
- Psychedelic-specific exposure modeling
- Real-time benchmarking (not retrospective research)
- No-PHI architecture (enables cross-site data)
- Practitioner-facing (not researcher-facing)

**First-Mover Advantage:**  
*"The first platform to hit N=1,000 protocols becomes the standard"*

---

## SLIDE 13: CLINICAL VALIDATION

### **Why Practitioners Will Use This**

**Pain Points We Solve:**

1. **"Am I doing this right?"**  
   → Network benchmarks show your clinic vs peers

2. **"What dose should I use?"**  
   → Similar patients data shows what worked

3. **"Is this interaction dangerous?"**  
   → Safety alerts flag drug interactions

4. **"How do I explain this to my patient?"**  
   → Patient-facing view shows evidence

5. **"Will this work for this patient?"**  
   → Predictive modeling shows probabilities

**Validation:**
- Dr. Shena (first user): "Hit the nail on the head"
- Dr. Fadiman precedent: 17 years proves demand
- MAPS conference growth: 800 → 10,000 attendees (field is ready)

---

## SLIDE 14: RESEARCH ACCELERATION

### **Why This Matters for the Field**

**Current State:**
- Clinical trials: 5-10 years, $10M+, N=100-500
- Publication lag: 2-3 years from data to journal
- Generalizability: Controlled settings ≠ real-world

**Our Model:**
- Real-world evidence: Continuous, $0 marginal cost, N=5,000+
- Publication lag: Real-time dashboards
- Generalizability: Actual clinical practice

**Impact:**
- **Protocol optimization:** Identify best practices 10x faster
- **Safety signals:** Detect adverse events earlier
- **Legislative change:** Compelling evidence for policymakers
- **Insurance coverage:** Real-world outcomes data

**The Vision:**  
*"Turn every clinical encounter into a research contribution"*

---

## SLIDE 15: REGULATORY POSITIONING

### **How We Navigate the Legal Landscape**

**Federal Illegality Challenge:**
- Psilocybin: Schedule I (federally illegal)
- Collecting PHI on illegal substances = legal exposure

**Our Solution:**
- No PHI = No federal exposure
- State-legal substances (ketamine, Oregon psilocybin) = safe
- Research framing: "Quality improvement," not "treatment"

**Legal Precedents:**
- Dr. Fadiman: 17 years, no legal issues
- Hemp Farm Bill: 0.3% THC loophole (cannabinoid data safe)
- Right to Try: Terminal patients have expanded access

**Regulatory Strategy:**
- Start with ketamine (federally legal)
- Expand to Oregon psilocybin (state-legal)
- Position as "research infrastructure," not "medical device"
- Avoid treatment efficacy claims

**Risk Mitigation:**
- No prescribing authority
- No diagnosis
- No guaranteed outcomes
- Language: "Tracks outcomes" not "improves outcomes"
