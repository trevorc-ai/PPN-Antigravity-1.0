# 💰 FREEMIUM PRICING STRATEGY
## Free Interaction Checker + Self-Reporting → Paid Tiers

**Created By:** LEAD  
**Date:** 2026-02-12 02:39 PST  
**Strategy:** Freemium with value-based upsell  
**Context:** Drive adoption with free tools, convert with premium features

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Core Insight:** Practitioners need safety tools NOW, but will pay for documentation and benchmarking.

**Freemium Model:**
- **Free Tier:** Interaction Checker + Self-Reporting (no credit card)
- **Paid Tiers:** Protocol logging, safety analytics, network benchmarking

**Why This Works:**
- **Low barrier to entry:** Free tools solve immediate pain (drug interactions)
- **High value perception:** "They gave me this for free? What else do they have?"
- **Natural upgrade path:** "I'm already using the free tools, might as well upgrade"
- **Viral growth:** Practitioners share free tools with colleagues

---
