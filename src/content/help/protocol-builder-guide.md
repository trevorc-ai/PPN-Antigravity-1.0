## Safety Features

### Drug Interaction Warnings

The Protocol Builder checks for interactions between your selected substance and any medications you add.

**Warning Levels:**
- 🔴 **Red (Contraindicated):** Do not combine these substances
- 🟡 **Yellow (Caution):** Use with care and monitor closely
- 🔵 **Blue (Monitor):** Be aware, but no major concerns

**What the warnings tell you:**
- **Severity:** How serious the interaction is
- **Mechanism:** Why the interaction occurs
- **Recommendation:** What action to take

---

### Dosage Validation

The system compares your entered dosage against established safety ranges.

**What happens:**
- ✅ **Safe Range:** No warning appears
- ⚠️ **High Dose:** Yellow warning appears
- 🚨 **Very High Dose:** Red warning appears

**Remember:** Dosage recommendations are guidelines. Individual patient factors may require adjustments.

---

### Contraindication Alerts

The system checks for conditions that may make treatment unsafe.

**Common contraindications:**
- Cardiovascular conditions (for certain substances)
- Psychiatric conditions (e.g., psychosis risk)
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding
- Specific medication interactions

---

## Best Practices

### How to Interpret Warnings

1. **Read the full warning message** - Don't just look at the color
2. **Check the mechanism** - Understand why the interaction occurs
3. **Review recommendations** - Follow suggested actions
4. **Use clinical judgment** - Warnings are advisory, not absolute

### When to Consult Additional Resources

You should seek additional guidance when:
- Multiple red warnings appear
- You're unfamiliar with a specific interaction
- Patient has complex medical history
- Dosage falls outside typical ranges

**Resources:**
- Peer consultation
- Medical literature
- Clinical guidelines
- Pharmacology references

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I save a protocol with warnings?

Yes. The system allows you to proceed with warnings because clinical context matters. However, you must acknowledge warnings before saving.

### How often is the safety data updated?

Our drug interaction database is updated quarterly with the latest research. Receptor affinity data is based on peer-reviewed studies.

### Can I edit a protocol after saving?

Yes. Go to "My Protocols," select the protocol you want to edit, and click "Edit." All safety checks will run again when you save changes.

### What if a medication isn't in the list?

If a medication isn't available in our dropdown, you can request it be added by contacting support. For immediate needs, consult additional drug interaction resources.

### Are these safety checks a substitute for clinical judgment?

No. The Protocol Builder is a decision support tool, not a replacement for your clinical expertise. Always consider individual patient factors and consult additional resources when needed.

### Can I share protocols with other practitioners?

Yes, if you have a Partner or Pro account. Shared protocols maintain all safety checks and warnings for the receiving practitioner to review.

### What happens if I enter a very high dosage?

The system will display a prominent red warning. You can still proceed, but you must acknowledge the warning. We recommend reviewing dosage guidelines before proceeding.

### How do I know if a drug interaction is serious?

Red warnings indicate serious interactions that could cause harm. Yellow warnings indicate interactions that require monitoring. Always read the full warning message and mechanism explanation.
