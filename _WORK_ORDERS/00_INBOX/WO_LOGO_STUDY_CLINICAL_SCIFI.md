# Minimalistic "Clinical Sci-Fi" Logo Study & Visual Identity

## 1. THE GOAL

Develop a minimalistic visual identity and logo for the PPN Research Portal that aligns with the "Augmented Intelligence" brand positioning.

### Logo Analysis
Conduct a study of current high-end medical-tech and AI data visualization logos.

### Minimalistic Design
Propose 3-5 logo concepts based on the following parameters:
* **Style:** Ultra-minimalist, high-fidelity, "Clinical Sci-Fi."
* **Motifs:** Abstract representations of neural networks, molecular structures, or data "hives."
* **Typography:** Pair the mark with a clean, monospace or high-legibility sans-serif typeface.

### Color Palette Integration
The logo must be designed to pop against the Deep Slate (#020408) background using Aurora gradient highlights (Clinical Green, Cyan, or Electric Purple).

### Scalability
Ensure the mark remains legible at favicon sizes (16x16px) and high-resolution header displays.

### Accessibility
The logo must maintain high contrast ratios and not rely on color alone for recognition (ensure the silhouette is distinct).

## 2. THE BLAST RADIUS (Authorized Target Area)

You are ONLY allowed to modify the following specific files/areas:
* `/brain/design/LOGO_STUDY_V1.md` (New Artifact)
* `/frontend/public/assets/branding/` (New logo export folder)
* `/frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` (For logo placement only)

---

## 3. THE ELECTRIC FENCE (Strict "DO NOT TOUCH" Constraints)

* **DO NOT** change the existing "Aurora" global background styles.
* **DO NOT** modify any clinical data components or navigation logic.
* **DO NOT** use complex, illustrative, or "cartoonish" styles; maintain a professional clinical aesthetic.
* **DO NOT** replace the logo in the Header until the **LEAD** has provided a "✅ APPROVED" comment on the Logo Study artifact.

---

## 4. MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

### ACCESSIBILITY
* The logo and any accompanying text must be clearly distinguishable.
* High contrast ratios required for visibility against Deep Slate background.
* Logo silhouette must be distinct without relying on color alone.

### SECURITY
* No PHI/PII data collection.

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis
- [ ] Study high-end medical-tech logo designs
- [ ] Analyze AI data visualization branding trends
- [ ] Document design principles and inspiration sources
- [ ] Create mood board for "Clinical Sci-Fi" aesthetic

### Phase 2: Concept Development
- [ ] Develop 3-5 minimalistic logo concepts
- [ ] Explore neural network motifs
- [ ] Explore molecular structure motifs
- [ ] Explore data "hive" motifs
- [ ] Pair each concept with appropriate typography

### Phase 3: Color & Contrast Testing
- [ ] Test logos against Deep Slate (#020408) background
- [ ] Apply Aurora gradient highlights (Clinical Green, Cyan, Electric Purple)
- [ ] Verify contrast ratios meet accessibility standards
- [ ] Ensure silhouette remains distinct in monochrome

### Phase 4: Scalability Testing
- [ ] Test legibility at favicon size (16x16px)
- [ ] Test at mobile header size
- [ ] Test at desktop header size
- [ ] Test at high-resolution displays
- [ ] Export in multiple formats (SVG, PNG, ICO)

### Phase 5: Documentation & Approval
- [ ] Create LOGO_STUDY_V1.md artifact with all concepts
- [ ] Include design rationale for each concept
- [ ] Provide usage guidelines
- [ ] Request LEAD approval
- [ ] Wait for "✅ APPROVED" before implementation
