## USER PROMPT
Transcript from voice memo:
"Put a little bit of space between 'Elevate your practice' and 'the clinical intelligence alliance'. I like that, but it just needs a little bit of space in between the two sentences. 
... This is a critical fail. The text is too small, and with the stars I can't even read it. I have to put it up on my screen. So, there's a lot of text anyway. So like, literally no waste of words. The copy is excellent, so I can update that, but brevity rules. Also I don't like the center justifying. I may want to see what it looks like with proper left justification. To me that just feels cleaner and I think it will present well. Not a big fan of much of the center justified body text is not my favorite."

## CUE ANALYSIS & REQUIREMENTS

1. **Space in Hero Headline**:
   - Add margin or padding to create clear separation between "Elevate your practice." and "The clinical intelligence alliance...".

2. **Mobile Typography & Contrast (Critical Fail)**:
   - Text is too small (`< 12px` violation or just visually illegible).
   - Poor contrast with the background 'stars'. 
   - **Action**: Increase text size dramatically. Consider dimming or removing stars directly behind the text, or adding a soft gradient text-shadow/background to ensure legibility.

3. **Text Alignment**:
   - The user strongly dislikes center-justified body text.
   - **Action**: Change the alignment of body text (the paragraph sections) from center-justified to left-justified. Clean up the container layout to support this cleanly within the mobile view.

*Note: This supersedes/enhances the layout adjustments identified in the previous mobile landing page ticket.*
