# WO-505: Batch UI/UX Refinements

## Instructions for User (Trevor)

This is your refinement intake ticket. Drop ALL of your refinements in the table below — cosmetic AND journey-related — in one pass. Don't hold back. LEAD will triage them into batches after.

**Format:** One row per refinement. Fill in:
- `Screen/Component` — what page or component it's on
- `What you see now` — describe the current state
- `What you want` — describe the desired state
- `Type` — choose one: `cosmetic`, `layout`, `functional`, `journey`, `data`
- `Priority` — `high`, `medium`, `low`

---

## Screenshot Context

Screenshots have been placed in: `public/screenshots/`  
Format: `.webp` ✅ (preferred — already the browser skill's native format)

When referencing a screenshot, include the filename in the `Notes` column.

## LEAD Triage Plan (to be filled in after user submits list)

LEAD will sort the refinements into execution batches:

### Batch A — Cosmetic / Pure CSS (→ DESIGNER + BUILDER, single ticket)
*Fast. No logic changes. Can be done in one pass.*

### Batch B — Layout / Structural (→ DESIGNER + BUILDER, single ticket)
*Component rearrangements, spacing, responsive fixes.*

### Batch C — Wellness Journey / Functional (→ BUILDER, individual tickets)
*These touch form state, data flow, or multi-step logic. Require QA.*

### Batch D — Data / Backend (→ SOOP + BUILDER, individual tickets)
*Any refinement that touches DB queries, RLS, or schema.*

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User has filled in all refinements
- [ ] LEAD has triaged into batches A/B/C/D
- [ ] Sub-tickets created per batch
- [ ] All sub-tickets routed to correct agents
