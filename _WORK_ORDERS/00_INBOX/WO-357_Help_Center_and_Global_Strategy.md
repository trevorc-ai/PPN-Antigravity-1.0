## USER PROMPT
Transcript from voice memo:
"Here's another idea is building in a QR code to the screen to every screen... where it's not really visible to the naked eye but maybe it's in the stars or just a slight different hue... that because our dashboards are already kind of set up for it. Anyway that's part of the global strategy is like two clicks. And if it's not obvious I'm just creating a giant to-do list for us because I need to be able to answer all these questions. Oh nice job on the Help Center. Except it's a great okay the help center is kind of how I want the site to look in terms of the background and the hues and the cool shading. But these columns are too narrow. So we've got to fix the... we've got to fix the Wellness Journey right away and the name of that may change by the way. But I think if we... I like the framing and I think if we promote it like you know the Wellness Journey to share into the portal... I think that's kind of the approach. Interested in hearing a strategic assessment on that."

## CUE ANALYSIS & REQUIREMENTS

1. **Invisible QR Code / Watermark Feature**:
   - Investigate embedding a steganographic or low-contrast QR code (or similar identifier) into the background/stars of every screen.
   - Purpose: Part of the broader global strategy ("two clicks" access or tracking).
   - Needs strategic assessment and technical feasibility check.

2. **Help Center Design Language**:
   - User loves the Help Center's background, hues, and "cool shading".
   - *Requirement*: This specific aesthetic should be adopted as the baseline look/feel for the rest of the site.

3. **Help Center Layout Bug**:
   - "These columns are too narrow." 
   - *Action*: Increase the width of the Topic Category columns/cards on the Help Center page.

4. **Wellness Journey UX/Strategy**:
   - "We've got to fix the Wellness Journey right away." (Likely referring to the layout or flow based on previous context and the visual style point).
   - Note: The name "Wellness Journey" may change.
   - Strategy request: User wants a strategic assessment (likely from PRODDY/MARKETER) on the framing and approach of promoting the Wellness Journey as a shareable element into the portal.
