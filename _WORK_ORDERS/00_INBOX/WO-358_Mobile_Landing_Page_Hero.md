## USER PROMPT
*Screenshot uploaded: Mobile Landing Page Hero Section*
- The image shows the mobile view of the landing page hero section. Based on the user's previous instruction, receiving an image without voice commentary means there is a visual or layout issue that needs to be addressed.

## CUE ANALYSIS & REQUIREMENTS

1. **Mobile Landing Page Hero Layout**:
   - The screenshot indicates issues with the typography and layout on mobile devices.
   - The main heading text ("Elevate your practice. The clinical intelligence alliance for psychedelic professionals.") has awkward line breaks and sizing on a narrow screen.
   - The badge at the top ("Augmented Intelligence for Psychedelic Wellness Practitioners") appears slightly cramped.
   - **Action**: DESIGNER and BUILDER need to review and adjust the mobile responsive styles (Tailwind classes like `text-4xl`, `leading-tight`, `md:text-6xl`, etc.) for the Landing Page hero section.
   - **Goal**: Ensure the text wraps cleanly, is legible, and looks aesthetically pleasing and intentional on mobile screens.
