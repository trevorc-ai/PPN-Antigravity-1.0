## User Request (Verbatim)

> "New Work Order (Non-Build) - User requests an update on live data connections to all HUD on each phase of the Wellness journey before further testing."

## CUE Summary

The user wants a full audit and status report on live data connections feeding every HUD component across all phases of the Wellness Journey. This is a non-build, read-only investigation task — no code changes are authorized.

## Open Questions

None — request was clear. The scope is all HUDs across all Wellness Journey phases; the deliverable is a status report on live vs. static/mock data connections, to be produced before further testing begins.

## Out of Scope

- Any code changes, bug fixes, or refactors
- HUD design or layout changes
- Any work outside of the Wellness Journey phases
