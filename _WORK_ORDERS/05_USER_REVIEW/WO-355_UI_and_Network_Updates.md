## USER PROMPT
Transcript from voice memo:
"Here is a roughly. I'll just record a voice for you. Okay. Uh audio uh audit logs look great except that um I just say make em denser so you can put more colors in there. Um the categorized medications is cool. I haven't tested the feature yet, but if you're going to categorize them, make the categories more obvious. I'm colorblind. Everything we do has to be checked for color accessibility and consistency with the CSS. Whatever the style guide, the font and color rules I want strict rules adhering like not but now that I figured the agent thing out it's probably going to get better. Um on the clinical network, we, uh, let's let people do anonymous. If a piece of maybe people will want to advertise their clinic but they don't want to put their names up. If people want to have a 100% anonymous, you know that will of course be fine. So um, but we are not a networking social network. This is a research and analytics portal. This is going to be really cool. But that being said I do not have a problem with people having profiles and we, you know, like just sort of let them send messages, you know, hey I want to because people might want to have a safe place to reach out anonymously. And um..."

## CUE ANALYSIS & REQUIREMENTS

1. **Audit Logs**:
   - Make the table/list rows denser to fit more visible information and colors on the screen.

2. **Secondary Agent Dropdown (Medications)**:
   - **Accessibility Priority**: The user is colorblind. Increase the obviousness of the categories without relying on color alone.
   - Use strict style guide constraints to differentiate category headers (e.g., font size, weights, clear borders/dividers).

3. **Clinical Network Profiles**:
   - Introduce an option for 100% Anonymous profiles (can showcase the clinic without displaying a practitioner's name).
   - Although it's a research/analytics portal rather than a social network, enable a private/anonymous messaging feature so practitioners have a safe place to connect.

*Note: The Intelligence Hub screenshot was also received and logged. Awaiting any verbal annotations on that specific mock.*
