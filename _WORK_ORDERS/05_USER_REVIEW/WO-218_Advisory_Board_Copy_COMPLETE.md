# WO-218: Advisory Board Recruitment Copy Suite

**Writing style applied throughout:** Short sentences. Plain words. No em dashes. Simple, understandable, and repeatable.

---

## 1. EMAIL SEQUENCE (5 emails, full body copy)

---

### EMAIL 1: The Initial Ask
**To:** Known contacts (Dr. Jason Allen, Sarah Honeycutt, John Turner, Bridger Lee Jensen)
**Subject:** Founding advisory seat, PPN Portal

Hi [Name],

I am building a clinical data platform for psychedelic therapy practitioners. It is called PPN Portal.

The platform gives sites a structured way to track patient outcomes across the full arc of care: preparation, dosing, and integration. Everything is anonymized and keyed to a practitioner-assigned ID. No PHI is stored.

I am forming a small founding advisory board before launch. The role is lightweight.

One async vote per month on clinical vocabulary additions. One 30-minute call per quarter. That is it.

No committee meetings. No governance overhead. Just your clinical judgment, applied directly to the language practitioners use to describe what they are seeing.

I think your [research background / clinical experience in Oregon / legal perspective / policy work in Utah] would be exactly the right voice for this.

Can I send you a 3-slide overview?

[YOUR NAME]

### EMAIL 2: The 3-Slide Overview Send
**Subject:** Re: Founding advisory seat, PPN Portal (overview)

Hi [Name],

Thanks for the interest. A short overview is attached.

Here is the plain version:

Practitioners doing psychedelic-assisted therapy are logging outcomes in notebooks, spreadsheets, and disconnected EHR fields. There is no shared vocabulary for what they are observing. PPN Portal gives them a structured, anonymous way to track outcomes across a 6-month arc of care.

The board's job is to keep the vocabulary honest.

When a practitioner encounters a concept that does not exist in the system yet ("somatic integration resistance," for example), they can submit a vocabulary request. The advisory board votes on whether to add it. If 3 or more sites submit the same concept, it goes on the board agenda. If 7 or more sites submit it, it fast-tracks to a 30-day review.

You are not ruling on treatment protocols. You are deciding whether a clinical concept belongs in the shared vocabulary.

One note on the competitive landscape: Safar, the closest product in this space, uses voice AI to generate unstructured notes. We use structured data from the start. Your vocabulary decisions are the reason that difference holds up over time.

Available for a 15-minute call this week?

### EMAIL 3: The Closing Ask
**Subject:** Advisory seat for [Name], official offer

Hi [Name],

I want to make this official.

We would like you as our [Research Credibility / Oregon Facilitation / Legal and Regulatory / Policy Intelligence] voice on the PPN Portal founding advisory board.

**What the role involves:**
- One vocabulary vote per month (about 5 minutes, done async via a simple form)
- One 30-minute call per quarter with the full board
- First review of major vocabulary additions before they go live to all sites

**What you receive:**
- Named advisory credit on the platform and on the public-facing site
- An advisory badge that appears next to your contributions in the vocabulary record
- Credit line in any publications or reports that cite the vocabulary

**Your first task, if you say yes:** Review 8 focus area categories in the vocabulary and tell me what is missing or mislabeled from your clinical experience. Takes about 20 minutes. We build your feedback directly into the tool.

Reply YES and I will send you the one-page seat description today.

[YOUR NAME]

### EMAIL 4: Onboarding (post-acceptance)
**Subject:** Welcome to the PPN Advisory Board

Hi [Name],

Welcome. You are one of [N] founding members.

Here is what happens next:

**This week:** I will send you the one-page seat description.

**Your first task is ready now:** Review 8 focus area categories in the ref vocabulary and flag anything that is missing, outdated, or mislabeled from your clinical perspective. This takes about 20 minutes. The link is at the bottom of this email.

**First board call:** [DATE]. Calendar invite coming this week.

A note on what this work actually does: the vocabulary you review will be used by practitioners at every site in the network. When you flag a missing concept, it does not go into a comment box. It goes into the review queue. If other sites flag the same thing, it hits the board agenda. If you are the one who spotted it first, your advisory credit appears next to the approved entry in the vocabulary record.

Your clinical judgment gets embedded directly into the tool.

Thank you for being here at the start.

### EMAIL 5: New Vocabulary Addition Notification
**Subject:** Your suggestion is now live

Hi [Name],

Quick update.

The concept you flagged, "[CONCEPT NAME]," has been approved and added to the PPN vocabulary. It is now available to practitioners at all [N] sites in the network.

What that means in practice: the next time a clinician logs a [behavioral change / focus area / homework assignment / session theme], they will see your suggested language as an option. Their data will be tagged with it. It will be searchable, reportable, and exportable.

Your advisory credit appears next to the entry in the vocabulary record.

This is how the vocabulary grows. One practitioner's observation becomes shared language for an entire network.

Thank you.

## 2. ADVISORY BOARD SEAT DESCRIPTIONS (7 seats)

---

### Seat 1: Research Credibility
**Ideal profile:** Dr. Jason Allen (or equivalent NIH/academic pedigree)

**Why this seat exists:**
Payers, IRBs, and hospital systems will ask whether PPN data is credible before they act on it. This seat exists to make sure our vocabulary and data model can survive peer review. The holder reviews vocabulary additions for scientific accuracy and flags any language that would not hold up in a publication.

**Time commitment:** Monthly async vote (5 minutes). Quarterly 30-minute call. Optional: co-authorship credit on vocabulary documentation papers.

**What the advisor receives:** Named Research Advisor credit. Co-authorship invitation on vocabulary publications. First access to aggregate network data for research purposes.

---

### Seat 2: Facilitation Practice
**Ideal profile:** Sarah Honeycutt (or equivalent licensed psychedelic facilitator in an active regulatory market)

**Why this seat exists:**
The vocabulary has to match what actually happens in the room during a session. This seat is the reality check. The holder reviews focus areas, homework categories, and session notes language to make sure it reflects the language facilitators actually use with patients.

**Time commitment:** Monthly async vote (5 minutes). Quarterly 30-minute call. Optional: first user on new form features before they go to the full network.

**What the advisor receives:** Named Facilitation Advisor credit. Early access to new features. Contribution credit on any vocabulary entries they originate.

---

### Seat 3: Legal and Regulatory
**Ideal profile:** John Turner (or equivalent health law background with psychedelic sector familiarity)

**Why this seat exists:**
The regulatory landscape for psychedelic therapy is moving fast. This seat reviews vocabulary and data model decisions for liability exposure. The holder flags anything that could create documentation risk for practitioners or the platform.

**Time commitment:** Monthly async vote (5 minutes). Quarterly 30-minute call. Available for ad-hoc review of new data fields before they go live (not frequent; estimated 2 to 3 times per year).

**What the advisor receives:** Named Legal Advisor credit. First look at new data model decisions that touch compliance. Network access to practitioners navigating the same regulatory landscape.

---

### Seat 4: Policy Intelligence
**Ideal profile:** Bridger Lee Jensen (or equivalent state-level policy experience in an emerging legal market)

**Why this seat exists:**
State-level policy changes determine which substances, treatment models, and practitioner types will be in scope for this platform. This seat tracks that landscape and flags vocabulary gaps or risks before they become problems.

**Time commitment:** Monthly async vote (5 minutes). Quarterly 30-minute call. Optional: brief policy briefings for the board when relevant legislation moves (estimated quarterly).

**What the advisor receives:** Named Policy Advisor credit. Platform access to see how practitioners in their state are using the vocabulary. Speaking credit at any PPN policy events.

---

### Seat 5: Trauma-Informed Practice
**Ideal profile:** Licensed clinician specializing in trauma (EMDR, somatic therapy, IFS, or equivalent)

**Why this seat exists:**
A significant portion of patients entering psychedelic-assisted therapy have trauma histories. The vocabulary for documenting trauma-related changes during integration needs to be precise, non-pathologizing, and clinically defensible. This seat owns that domain.

**Time commitment:** Monthly async vote (5 minutes). Quarterly 30-minute call.

**What the advisor receives:** Named Trauma-Informed Practice Advisor credit. Contribution credit on vocabulary entries in the trauma and somatic domains.

---

### Seat 6: Psychiatry and Prescribing
**Ideal profile:** MD or DO with prescribing experience in psychedelic-adjacent contexts (ketamine, MDMA-assisted, or psilocybin clinical trial experience preferred)

**Why this seat exists:**
Safety vocabulary is the highest-stakes vocabulary in the system. This seat reviews all fields related to adverse events, chemical rescue, vital signs thresholds, and dose-response documentation. Nothing in the safety domain goes live without this seat's vote.

**Time commitment:** Monthly async vote (5 minutes). Quarterly 30-minute call. Required for any safety-domain vocabulary vote (these are flagged separately and do not require full board presence for non-safety items).

**What the advisor receives:** Named Medical Advisor credit. First access to safety event aggregate data across the network for research or quality improvement purposes.

---

### Seat 7: Patient and Community Voice
**Ideal profile:** Individual with lived experience in psychedelic-assisted therapy, ideally also active in peer support, advocacy, or community facilitation

**Why this seat exists:**
The vocabulary has to make sense to the people it describes, not just the people documenting it. This seat reviews patient-facing language, consent-related vocabulary, and any terms patients might see in their own journey documentation. They flag anything that feels clinical in a way that creates distance instead of trust.

**Time commitment:** Monthly async vote (5 minutes). Quarterly 30-minute call.

**What the advisor receives:** Named Community Advisor credit. Consultation fee for any in-depth vocabulary review sessions (beyond the standard async vote). Recognition in any patient-facing platform materials.

## 4. OPEN VOCABULARY STANDARD POSITIONING DOC

**Title:** Why we are open-sourcing our clinical vocabulary

**Audience:** Researchers, practitioners, policy makers

**Length:** One page

---

Clinical vocabulary for psychedelic-assisted therapy does not exist in a usable form. Practitioners across the country are documenting the same concepts with different words. Researchers cannot aggregate data across studies because the fields do not match. Payers cannot evaluate outcomes because the outcomes are not described in a shared language.

PPN Portal is building that shared vocabulary. And we are making it open.

**What open means:**

Any researcher or institution can cite the PPN vocabulary in their publications. Any practitioner can submit concepts for review through their site. Any approved addition is credited to the practitioner who originated it and visible to every site in the network.

The vocabulary is not proprietary. It belongs to the practitioners who built it.

**Why this matters:**

Proprietary vocabularies create lock-in. If your data is tagged with our terms and we close or pivot, your data becomes unreadable. Open vocabularies travel with you. Your outcomes data stays interpretable regardless of what platform you use in the future.

**How it works:**

When a practitioner types a concept that does not exist in the vocabulary yet, they can submit it as a vocabulary request. The advisory board votes on it. If 3 or more sites submit the same concept, it goes on the board agenda. At 7 sites, it fast-tracks. At 15, it gets presumptive approval pending safety review.

Your clinical judgment drives the vocabulary. We just run the process.

**The PR hook for researchers:**

The PPN vocabulary can be cited in publications as a living clinical reference. As the vocabulary grows, so does its citability. Advisory board members get co-authorship credit on any vocabulary documentation papers we publish.

## 5. SAFAR COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION

**For internal use and advisor briefings. Not for public distribution yet.**

| Dimension | Safar | PPN Portal |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Data structure | Voice AI generates unstructured notes | Structured fields, controlled vocabulary |
| Vocabulary | Emergent from voice transcription | Clinician-voted, advisory-governed |
| Data portability | Tied to Safar's parsing model | Open vocabulary, exportable |
| Regulatory posture | Unclear how voice notes handle documentation standards | Structured fields designed for audit-readiness |
| Research usability | Requires NLP to extract concepts from notes | Data is already coded and queryable |
| Practitioner effort | Low friction at input, high friction at analysis | Structured at input, instant at analysis |

**One-line positioning:**
Safar captures what practitioners say. PPN captures what practitioners mean.

The distinction holds because our vocabulary is defined in advance by the practitioners who actually use it, not inferred after the fact by a language model.
