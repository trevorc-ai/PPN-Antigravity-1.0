# PPN × OHSU Partnership Brief
## Approaching the OPEN Study Team at Oregon Health & Science University

**Prepared by:** PRODDY + ANALYST  
**Date:** 2026-02-21  
**Classification:** Confidential — Executive Use Only  
**Purpose:** Equip the PPN founder for an outreach conversation with OHSU's OPEN study team

---

## 1. WHAT IS OPEN?

**OPEN = Oregon Psychedelic Evaluation Nexus**

- **Funder:** NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) — $3.3M grant
- **Lead Institution:** Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)
- **PI:** Likely within OHSU's Department of Psychiatry or the Methamphetamine and Neuroscience Research Lab — confirm the current PI before reaching out
- **Study window:** 2024–2028 (5-year longitudinal)
- **What they're doing:** The first federally-funded, real-world outcomes registry for legal psilocybin services in Oregon. Enrolling both facilitators AND clients from Oregon-licensed psilocybin service centers. 1-year longitudinal follow-ups using standardized outcome measures (the same instruments PPN uses: PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5, AUDIT, etc.)
- **Public website:** `https://openpsychedelicscience.org/`

## 2. WHY WE WANT THIS

This is **not** just a data deal. This is a legitimacy acquisition.

### What OPEN gives PPN:

| Benefit | Strategic Value |
|---------|----------------|
| Access to real-world facilitator + client longitudinal data | Powers naturalistic benchmark layer — the most directly relevant comparison data for PPN practitioners |
| "Contributing site" status | Every PPN practitioner who uses OPEN becomes part of federal research — this is the strongest possible credibility signal |
| Federal registry association | NIDA-backed is investor-grade validation; it's press-worthy on its own |
| Academic citation pipeline | OHSU researchers will cite PPN's platform in papers — direct SEO and reputational value |
| Regulatory positioning | If (when) federal legality expands, being embedded in federal registry infrastructure from the start is a 5-year moat |

**The asymmetric insight:** OHSU needs two things they currently struggle to get: (1) practitioners who will actually use their data capture instruments, and (2) a technology platform that doesn't require practitioners to use a separate app. PPN solves both.

---

## 3. WHAT WE OFFER THEM

This conversation fails if it reads as "we want your data." It succeeds when it reads as "we have something you need."

### PPN's Value Proposition to OHSU:

**A. Practitioner Coverage Depth**
OPEN is trying to enroll facilitators across Oregon's legal psilocybin centres. PPN is the operational platform many of these facilitators already use (or should use). If PPN becomes a registered OPEN submission interface, OHSU gets access to a practitioner network they cannot build themselves.

**B. Standardized Data Capture Already Built**
PPN already captures: PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5, AUDIT, ACE score, session vitals, adverse events, integration notes — all the instruments OPEN uses. We can submit OHSU's required data elements directly from our existing forms, without requiring facilitators to fill out a separate instrument.

**C. Long-Term Follow-Up Infrastructure**
OPEN requires 1-year longitudinal follow-up data, which is extremely hard to capture in practice. PPN's Wellness Journey is specifically designed for longitudinal outcome tracking. We can be the retention infrastructure for OHSU's long-term follow-up data.

**D. Quality Assurance Layer**
PPN flags incomplete records, prompts for follow-up, and tracks documentation completeness. This directly improves OHSU's data quality — a persistent problem in real-world registry studies.

**E. Mutual Benefit: We Get, You Get**
| PPN Gets | OHSU Gets |
|----------|-----------|
| Registry data access for our benchmark layer | Practitioner coverage across Oregon sites |
| "NIDA OPEN Registry Partner" designation | Standardized digital data capture |
| Academic citation and co-authorship paths | Long-term follow-up infrastructure |
| Investor-grade credibility | Higher data quality and completeness |

---

## 4. THE ASK (What We Want)

Keep the first conversation narrow and achievable. Do NOT lead with "we want your data." Lead with "we want to support your research infrastructure."

### Phase 1 Ask (First Conversation)
> *"We'd like to explore whether PPN could become a technology partner for OPEN — specifically by enabling PPN practitioners who are licensed Oregon facilitators to submit their session and outcome data directly to OPEN's registry through our platform. We'd build the integration; you'd get the data without adding friction to your facilitators."*

**Done when:** OHSU agrees to a discovery call with their study coordinator and/or data team.

### Phase 2 Ask (After Discovery)
> *"We'd like to formalize PPN as a registered OPEN data submission site — meaning that facilitators using PPN can satisfy their OPEN data requirements through our interface."*

**Done when:** A data sharing agreement or MOU is signed.

### Phase 3 (12–18 months)
- Co-authorship on OHSU's first real-world outcomes paper using OPEN data
- PPN cited as the data capture platform in the methods section
- Potential joint grant application (NIH SBIR/STTR programs explicitly fund technology platforms supporting clinical research)

## 5. HOW TO APPROACH (Tactical Recommendations)

### If you have a connection at OHSU:

**Option A: Direct internal referral (preferred)**
Ask your connection to introduce you specifically to the OPEN study PI or the study coordinator. A warm intro from inside OHSU is worth 10 cold emails. Frame the ask to your connection:
> *"I'm working on a clinical outcomes platform for psychedelic therapy practitioners. I'd love to explore whether PPN could support the OPEN study's data infrastructure — could you introduce me to the right PI or study coordinator?"*

Do not ask your connection to advocate for PPN — just ask for the introduction. Let the pitch speak for itself.

**Option B: If your connection is a researcher (not clinical)**
Ask them to review PPN's data architecture and provide a letter of support or informal endorsement before your outreach to the OPEN team. A researcher at OHSU saying "I've reviewed their platform and it's methodologically sound" is a powerful foot in the door.

**Option C: Cold outreach (if no direct connection works)**
Use the OPEN website contact form, but frame as a technology partnership inquiry, not a data request:
> Subject: Technology Partnership Inquiry — Real-World Registry Data Capture for OPEN Study
> 
> "We're developing a clinical outcomes platform currently used by [X] psychedelic therapy practitioners. We believe PPN could function as a standardized data capture and submission partner for OPEN — reducing friction for facilitators without adding a new tool to their workflow. I'd welcome the opportunity to share our architecture and explore whether this is a fit."

### Timing
Oregon's legal psilocybin services are in early operation. OHSU is actively recruiting facilitator sites. Now is the optimal window — they need practitioners; we need credibility. In 18 months, they'll have the data they need and the leverage shifts.

## 6. DUE DILIGENCE BEFORE THE CALL

Before reaching out, have answers to these questions:

**About PPN's Data:**
- [ ] How many Oregon-licensed psilocybin facilitators are currently using or trialing PPN?
- [ ] Are any of PPN's current practitioners operating under Oregon Measure 110 licensing?
- [ ] Can PPN export data in CDISC format (the federal standard for clinical trial data submission)? (If not, say "we can build this.")

**About OPEN's Requirements:**
- [ ] What instruments does OPEN require? (Visit `openpsychedelicscience.org` and download their protocol)
- [ ] What are their data submission timelines and formats?
- [ ] Does OPEN require IRB coverage for partner sites? (PPN would need to be added to OHSU's IRB protocol)

**Regulatory:**
- [ ] Is PPN HIPAA-compliant? (This will be the first question a federal research team asks)
- [ ] Does PPN have a BAA (Business Associate Agreement) template?
- [ ] Is there a data processing agreement template ready?

## 8. RISK REGISTER

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| OHSU wants IRB coverage PPN doesn't have | Medium | High | Scope initial partnership to aggregate-only data sharing; IRB not required for de-identified aggregate |
| OHSU's timeline is longer than PPN's runway | Medium | Medium | Build the integration anyway — it works for any registry partnership, not just OPEN |
| Facilitators don't want to share data with federal registry | Medium | Medium | Make OPEN submission a strict opt-in feature; never auto-enroll |
| OHSU already has a preferred tech partner | Low | High | Reframe to: "Can PPN feed data into your existing infrastructure?" rather than "can we replace it?" |
| Connection at OHSU is not in the right department | Medium | Low | Ask for a warm referral to the correct contact rather than a pitch |

---

## 9. THE BIGGER PICTURE

If this partnership works, PPN becomes:

1. The technology platform cited in the first federal real-world psilocybin outcomes study
2. A registered OPEN submission site — meaning future NIH grants can route through PPN
3. A natural partner for every future NIDA-funded registry study in Colorado (Prop 122), Australia, and wherever legal frameworks emerge next
4. The organization that publishes the "PPN Network Intelligence Report" alongside OHSU's academic findings — two complementary bodies of evidence, one from the clinical practice side, one from the research side

> *"The fastest way to become the data infrastructure of an emerging field is to embed in the first federally-funded registry. This is that moment."*
