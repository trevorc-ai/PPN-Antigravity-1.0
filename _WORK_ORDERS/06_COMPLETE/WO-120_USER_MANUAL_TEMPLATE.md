# WO-120: PPN Research Portal — User Manual Template

## User Request (Verbatim)
> "We need to build a user manual. I am collecting screenshots, and part of what I was going to use the inventory list that I asked you for earlier was for exactly that. Are you able to research user manual best practices and start me a template with the text from our notes? Is that something you can do?"

---

## PRODDY STRATEGY

### Research Conducted
- Reviewed user manual best practices for SaaS and clinical software (2024 standards)
- Audited all project notes: VoC research, strategic synthesis, component inventory, UAT guide, UX/IA audit, business partner invitation doc, and comprehensive app strategy
- Cross-referenced the complete page list (65+ pages) and the 19 Arc of Care forms

### Key Best Practices Applied
1. **Audience-first structure** — Written for practitioners, admins, and integration specialists; avoids developer jargon
2. **Task-based organization** — Sections follow user goals (Getting Started → Clinical Workflow → Knowledge → Analytics) not feature lists
3. **Screenshot placeholder system** — Every screenshot need is tagged `[SCREENSHOT: ...]` in situ; Appendix B is a prioritized capture checklist
4. **Privacy-forward language** — Zero-PHI architecture explained in plain English; not buried in legal copy
5. **Clinical context** — All clinical forms explained with their purpose and the data they capture, not just their names
6. **Comprehensive glossary** — All domain-specific terms (PAT, MEQ-30, PHQ-9, Safe Harbor, RLS, etc.) defined for mixed audiences
7. **Complete form reference** — Appendix A is a full table of all 19 Arc of Care forms by phase, with key data captured and notes

### Deliverable
**File Location:** `.agent/research/PPN_USER_MANUAL_TEMPLATE_v1.md`

## FOR USER REVIEW

### What I Need From You, Trevor

1. **Screenshots** — Work through Appendix B (the Screenshot Collection Guide) in priority order. The manual is complete and ready to receive them wherever you see `[SCREENSHOT: ...]`.

2. **Accuracy Review** — Read through each section and flag anything that doesn't match what you see in the live portal (some features may have been updated since the notes were written).

3. **Tone Check** — Does the language feel right for your target reader (licensed clinicians)? Let me know if it needs to be more technical, more plain-spoken, or more reassuring in any sections.

4. **Missing Sections** — Are there any features or workflows not covered that you want added?

5. **Format** — This is a `.md` file right now. Do you want it converted to:
   - A PDF (I can create a formatted version)
   - A web page (inline in the app's Help Center)
   - A Google Doc (for collaborative editing)
   - All of the above?

### Suggested Next Routing

After your review:
- **Screenshot collection** → You (this is the manual work that requires human screen access)
- **Copyediting/tone refinement** → MARKETER (WO-121, if needed)
- **Help Center integration** (embedding the manual in the app) → BUILDER (WO-122, if needed)
- **PDF export design** → DESIGNER (WO-123, if needed)
