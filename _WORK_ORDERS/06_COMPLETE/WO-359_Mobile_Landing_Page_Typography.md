## USER PROMPT
*Screenshot uploaded: Mobile Landing Page Hero Section (Lower Half)*
- The image shows the mobile view of the landing page, specifically the sub-headline, description text, notice block, and primary call-to-action buttons. Receiving an image without voice commentary indicates a visual or layout issue to be logged.

## CUE ANALYSIS & REQUIREMENTS

1. **Mobile Landing Page Typography & Readability**:
   - The screenshot shows the text sections ("Log your sessions...", "A unified platform...", and the Notice block) looking potentially too small or having low contrast against the dark background.
   - **Accessibility Check**: Ensure all text in this mobile view strictly adheres to the `>= 12px` font size rule.
   - **Action**: DESIGNER and BUILDER need to review the mobile responsive typography (`text-sm`, `text-base` etc.) and line height in the hero section to improve legibility.
   - **Goal**: Make sure the text elements are easy to read and properly spaced on smaller screens.

2. **Button Layout**:
   - The secondary button ("Watch Demo") is partially obscured. Ensure adequate bottom padding or margin is present so crucial interactive elements aren't cut off by default mobile browser UI.
