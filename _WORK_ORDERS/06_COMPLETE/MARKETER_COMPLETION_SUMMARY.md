## MARKETER SIGN-OFF

✅ **All deliverables complete and ready for LEAD review.**

**Quality Assurance:**
- All copy is grounded in VoC research (5+ sources cited per work order)

2. **Route WO-062 (Pricing Data Bounty)** to INSPECTOR for legal review of Data Contribution Agreement
3. **Route WO-050 (Landing Page Marketing)** to DESIGNER for visual implementation

**Questions for LEAD:**
1. Should we create a separate work order for email nurture sequences (lead magnet follow-ups)?
2. Should we create a separate work order for "Alliance" branding updates across the entire site (not just landing page)?
3. Should we prioritize the free-tier Drug Interaction Checker as a standalone feature (separate work order)?
