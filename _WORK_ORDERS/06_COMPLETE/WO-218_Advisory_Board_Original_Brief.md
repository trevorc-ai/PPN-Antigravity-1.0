## MANDATE (from Turning_Point.md)

> MARKETER: "Advisory boards in healthcare aren't just governance — they're your first press release, your first case study, and your first referral network. Before launch: Recruit 5-7 founding advisory board members from existing practitioner relationships."

> USER: "Advisory board will be no problem, people are standing by to see if we truly have something of value."

## CONTEXT: KNOWN CONTACTS (from Turning_Point.md)

| Contact | Profile | Advisory Role |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Dr. Jason Allen | NIH/research pedigree | IRB credibility + publication pipeline |
| Sarah Honeycutt | Oregon facilitator | First practitioner user, ref_ vocabulary validator |
| John Turner | Retired VC attorney, festival community | Legal/regulatory + network access |
| Bridger Lee Jensen | Utah policy | Emerging legal market intelligence |

MARKETER must also define the remaining 3-4 seats needed and the ideal profile for each.

## MARKETER DELIVERABLES

### 1. Advisory Board Recruitment Email Sequence (5 emails)

**Email 1: The Initial Ask (to existing contacts)**
- Subject: "Founding Advisory Seat — PPN Portal"
- Framing: "30 minutes reviewing clinical vocabulary, not committee meetings"
- Include: What the advisory role actually involves (monthly async vote, quarterly call)
- CTA: "Can I send you a 3-slide overview?"

**Email 2: The 3-Slide Overview Send**
- Attach concept summary (reference WO-208 PRD for content)
- Include competitive context (Safar positioned as "OS for transformation" — PPN is the structured outcomes network)
- CTA: "15-minute call this week?"

**Email 3: The Closing Ask**
- Specific seat offer: "We'd like you as our [Research Credibility / Oregon Facilitation] voice"
- Compensation model: recognition, advisory badge in platform, vocabulary contribution credit
- CTA: "Reply YES and I'll send the one-page seat description"

**Email 4: Onboarding Email (post-acceptance)**
- Welcome + what happens next
- First job: "Review these 8 focus areas in our ref_ vocabulary and tell us what's missing"
- Sets expectation: first ask is immediate and high-value

**Email 5: New Vocabulary Addition Notification**
- Template for when their suggestion gets approved and added
- Reinforces: "Your clinical judgment is now in the vocabulary for all 14 sites"

### 2. Advisory Board Seat Descriptions

For each of the 7 seats, write a one-paragraph description of:
- Why this expertise matters to the vocabulary
- What the commitment is (time, format)
- What the advisory member receives

### 3. Launch Announcement Template

Hold until all 5+ founding members confirmed. Template:
- Headline: "PPN Portal launches with [N] clinical advisory board members"
- Body: Named advisors + their credentials
- Quote from founding member (get pre-approval)
- Quote from you (USER)
- CTA: "Apply for early access" (links to gated waitlist)

### 4. Open Vocabulary Standard Positioning Doc

One-page positioning: "Why we're open-sourcing our clinical vocabulary"
- Addresses: vocabulary licensing risk (Turning_Point.md concern)
- Framing: "Built with practitioners, for practitioners" → contributors feel ownership
- PR hook: researchers can cite/reference the vocabulary in publications

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 5-email sequence written (all body copy, not just outlines)
- [ ] 7 seat descriptions written
- [ ] Launch announcement template ready to publish with [NAME] placeholders
- [ ] Open vocabulary standard positioning doc written
- [ ] Safar competitive differentiation documented (their voice AI vs. our structured data)
