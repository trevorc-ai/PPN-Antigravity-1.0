## The Core Opportunity

We are not ready for a broad GTM motion. We do not need one. What we need is one strategic anchor client who validates the product, funds near-term development, and becomes the reference case for every subsequent conversation.

**Singularism** is the recommended first target.

---

## Why Singularism

- They operate in legal psychedelic therapy contexts (Oregon and emerging state programs)
- They are credible enough that "Singularism chose PPN Portal" becomes meaningful to the next ten clinics
- They are operationally complex enough to stress-test the product
- They are not so large that a failed pilot damages us irreparably
- We share the same buyer profile: regulatory-aware clinic administrators

---

## Recommended Structure: Design Partner Agreement

**Position it as:** "We are selecting a small number of pioneering clinics to co-build the future of psychedelic therapy data infrastructure."

**Not:** "Buy our software."

| What They Get | Price |
|---------------|-------|
| Full platform access | |
| Direct roadmap input | |
| PPN team onboarding support | |
| Permanent Research Partner pricing lock-in | |
| Co-marketing rights ("Founding Clinical Partner") | **$15,000–$25,000 lump sum / 12 months** |

One lump sum. No monthly billing complexity. Wire transfer.

**What we do with it:** Fund the final sprint to production readiness (Phase 3 data, beta testing with Dr. Allen and Dr. Vanderpoeg). The pilot client pays for the last 10% of the build.

---

## The Pitch (Partner-Ready Language)

> "We've built clinical data infrastructure for psychedelic therapy that no one else has built. Our system is structured so that, even in ten years, when regulators ask what data was collected and how we protected it, the answer is airtight. We are inviting three founding clinical partners to join before we go to market. The investment is [X]. Partners get the platform, they get our attention, and they get permanent pricing that everyone who comes later won't have access to."

## Additional Monetization Options (Ranked by Speed)

### 1. Clinical Data Architecture Assessment — $3,000–$8,000 flat (Fastest)
Before a software agreement, offer a standalone paid assessment. Two-hour call with their leadership, review of current data practices, 10-page report on PHI exposure and how PPN closes the gaps. No code changes required. Natural path into a platform sale.

### 2. Research Alliance Founding Membership — $499/mo, annual upfront ($5,988)
Offer five clinics founding "Research Alliance" membership. They get the benchmark intelligence layer (their outcomes vs. anonymized global cohort) before it's in the main product. Five conversations = $30K ARR.

### 3. Advisory Board Research Partner — Exchange, not cash
For Dr. Allen and Dr. Vanderpoeg: do not charge them money. Offer a formal Research Partner designation in exchange for structured feedback, testimonials, and reference rights. Worth more than their subscription fee.

---

## Approval Process Preference (from USER)
- USER does not want to manually approve anything except six-figure enterprise sales
- All routine workflow approvals handled by INSPECTOR
- Strategic and database decisions escalate to USER only

---

## Search Portal Decision (Relevant Context)
- Old search portal is being retired — it was buried and unfindable
- Replacing with a **Global Command Palette** (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`)
- V1 indexes: app routes, substance names, help articles
- Patient IDs stay in the Patient Select modal (clinical flow, not global search)
- Work order WO-403 created and in DESIGNER queue

## For the New Chat — Suggested Starting Prompt

> "PRODDY, we have an opportunity to approach Singularism with a Design Partner offer for PPN Portal. Context file is in `_WORK_ORDERS/PRODDY_Singularism_Brief_2026-02-23.md`. I need help drafting the actual outreach message and deciding on the exact pricing and terms. Let's use first-person plural and keep the language tight enough to share directly."

---

## Current Beta Readiness Context
- Target: Dr. Jason Allen + Dr. Shena Vanderpoeg
- Estimated readiness: ~60% (Roomba cleanup done, Phase 3 data wiring next)
- Sprint B in progress: Phase 3 data hooks, command palette, ref_ table seeding
- Code freeze lifted as of 2026-02-23 09:36 PST
