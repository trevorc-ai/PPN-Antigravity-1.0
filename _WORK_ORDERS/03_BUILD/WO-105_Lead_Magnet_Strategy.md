# WO-105: Lead Magnet Strategy - Risk Assessment

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Design and define the "Free Tool" that sits *outside* the paywall to drive email capture. The concept is a "Quick Safety Audit."

## 📋 CORE CONCEPT: "Protocol Safety Checker"
- **User input:** Selects substance, dose, setting (Solo, Sitter, Clinic), and pre-existing conditions (checkboxes).
- **Output:** A "Risk Score" (Low/Med/High) with 3 actionable recommendations.
- **Hook:** "Get the Full Report + Legal Audit Trail inside Phantom Shield."

## 🚚 DELIVERABLES
1. **Tool Logic:** (MARKETER defines questions/logic).
2. **Copy:** Questions, answers, results page copy.
3. **Follow-up Sequence:** Email drip for people who take the quiz.
   - "Your Risk Assessment Results" -> "How to Document Safety" -> "Phantom Shield Offer".
