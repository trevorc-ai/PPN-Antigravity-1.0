# Singularism Agreement, INTERNAL NEGOTIATION NOTES
**For:** Your eyes only
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Companion to:** Singularism_Design_Partner_Agreement_DRAFT_2026-02-23.md

---

## Pricing Strategy

- Open: $35,000
- First concession (only if blocked): $28,000 + add one extra feedback session
- Walk-to: $25,000
- Hard floor: $22,000. Below this, the precedent damages every subsequent clinic conversation.
- Do NOT volunteer split payment. If they ask, offer $20K on signing + $15K at 6 months.

## Strongest Leverage Points

- Their participant records were physically seized. Our system has nothing seizable. That is not a marketing claim, it is a technical fact.
- Jason has the relationship. He presents the agreement in conversation, does not email it cold.
- Bridger sees himself publicly as a pioneer establishing legal precedent. Mirror that framing back.

## Fill-In Items Before Signing

- [COMPANY NAME]: your legal entity name
- [STATE]: governing state for the agreement
- $[X]: the permanent Research Partner annual rate to lock in (decide this before sending)
- Jason's countersignature process: DocuSign preferred, or signed PDF returned by email
- Wire transfer details: have these ready before the close call, not after
