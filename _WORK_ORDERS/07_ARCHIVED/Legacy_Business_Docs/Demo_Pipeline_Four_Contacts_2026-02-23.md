## Contact 1: Bridger Lee Jensen, Singularism
**Lead:** Jason
**Status:** All materials ready. Message ready to send. Do not lock demo date until the QA seeder is confirmed complete.

**Key messaging points:**
- Warm follow-up. He asked to be a beta tester. This is the yes.
- Platform is ready to show, not just a concept anymore
- We want him in the founding cohort specifically
- Ask for 30 minutes, no agenda stated beyond showing him the product
- No price or terms in the first message

**Demo focus:**
- Anonymous Subject ID generation, nothing in system that can be seized
- Consent form, timestamped and immutable
- Audit log, chain of evidence
- Phase 3 outcome data, what the work produces scientifically

**Post-demo:** One-pager and agreement summary within 24 hours

## Contact 2: Dr. Jason Allen, ND, MPH
**Lead:** You
**Status:** Warm. You have met. He is waiting.
**Background:** 20 years of active psychedelic therapy practice, conducted under the radar. Scientist, educator, crusader. NIH-funded. Has expressed interest in advisory involvement, mutual.

**Key messaging points:**
- Simple follow-up to your prior meeting. It is ready to show.
- Reference the specific conversation you had
- Ask for 30 minutes
- Do not pitch in the outreach. He is already in.

**Demo focus:**
- Lead with the data quality story, not the compliance story
- He chose the risk for 20 years. He does not need protection framing.
- Show what structured, longitudinal, comparable data produces at network scale
- PHQ-9 trajectory chart in Phase 3 is the emotional peak for him
- "What We Collect" schema document when ready

**Key talking point:**
- 20 years of undocumented outcomes. Everything collected in PPN going forward feeds a dataset that can change clinical standards.
- This is what makes his life's work legible to the rest of the field.

**Post-demo structure conversation:**
- Do not assume advisory / non-cash. Have an honest conversation.
- May want a Founding Partner commercial relationship
- Or advisory hybrid: platform access in exchange for structured feedback and reference rights
- His credibility as a long-practicing clinician-scientist has real value for investor and advisor conversations

## Contact 3: Julian J. Varela, MA, LMFT, MS, CSCS
**Lead:** Jason
**Status:** Pending. Jason to initiate.
**Background:** Marriage and Family Therapist plus strength and conditioning science. Active clinical practice in Ventura, CA. Licensed in CA, AZ, NV, OR.

**Confirm before outreach:**
- Is he actively practicing or exploring psychedelic-assisted therapy?
- Has Jason had any prior conversation about PPN with him?

**Key messaging points (for Jason):**
- Peer-to-peer, keep it casual and in Jason's voice
- "We built something I want to show you" angle
- Practitioner-first framing. This is a tool for his practice, not a research platform.
- Ask for 30 minutes

**Demo focus:**
- Wellness Journey workflow, create a patient, document a session
- Structured forms, he will appreciate clinical rigor over free-form notes
- Interaction Checker, clinical safety is his world
- Keep data architecture explanation minimal. Show it in action, do not lecture it.

**Proposed structure:** Decide after demo. If actively entering the space: Guild tier or Founding Partner. If exploratory: Research Partner / Advisory exchange.

## Contact 4: Dr. Shena Vanderploeg, ND
**Lead:** You
**Status:** Personal relationship. Your outreach when the timing feels right.
**Background:** Naturopathic doctor, bioidentical hormone therapy, TRT, and cannabis products. Close personal friend.

**Note:** Not currently a psychedelic therapy practitioner. Her cannabis background gives her the regulatory vocabulary that maps directly to this space. She may be watching the landscape.

**Confirm before outreach:**
- Is she curious about psychedelic-assisted therapy as a modality she might add?
- Or is this more of a friend conversation about what we are building?

**Key messaging points:**
- Personal conversation first, not a pitch
- Share the vision and show her what we built
- She will ask intelligent data and compliance questions. Her cannabis background means she understands gray-area regulated spaces.

**Demo focus (if she is curious about the modality):**
- Wellness Journey, full patient arc
- Safety story: structured forms, controlled vocabulary, no free-text, no PHI
- Interaction Checker, she will immediately connect this to her drug-interaction knowledge from cannabis practice
- "What We Collect" schema, she will want to understand what the system actually stores

**Proposed structure:** Research Partner / Advisory, non-commercial initially. Her naturopathic and cannabis practitioner network is a referral channel worth more than a subscription. Revisit commercial structure if she moves into the modality.

- Demo Bridger
- Demo Dr. Allen

**When Jason has confirmed Varela's practice direction:**
- Jason reaches out and schedules
