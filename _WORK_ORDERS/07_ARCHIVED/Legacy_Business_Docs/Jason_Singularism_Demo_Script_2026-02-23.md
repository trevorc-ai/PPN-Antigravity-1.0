## Before You Start

**Pre-call setup (10 minutes before):**
- [ ] Browser open at `/`, logged out, full screen
- [ ] Login credentials pre-entered (just press Enter)
- [ ] QA seeder has been run. Phase 3 shows real data, no DEMO DATA badges visible.
- [ ] Screen sharing from a large monitor, not a laptop
- [ ] Camera on. This is a relationship call, not a webinar.

**What Bridger already knows:**
He has seen an early concept. He has been waiting. He knows it is a clinical data platform for practitioners in this space. Do not re-explain the premise. Show him what it became.

## The Script

---

### Minute 0 to 1 | Opening (verbal only, no screen share yet)

> "Thanks for making time. We have been heads-down building since you last saw it. It is a different thing now. I am going to show you the actual running platform. I will walk you through the core workflow, then I want to hear what you think. Sound good?"

Start screen share. Browser at `/`.

---

### Minute 1 to 3 | Landing Page

Scroll slowly through the hero section.

> "This is what a practitioner or administrator sees when they land on it. The core premise is right there, clinical data infrastructure for psychedelic therapy that no one else has built. The things EHRs can not handle, the documentation that has always been an afterthought. This is what we built."

Point to the "PHI-safe" and "compliance" language.

> "That language is doing real work. It is not marketing copy. It is what the architecture is designed around. Which is what I want to show you."

Navigate to `/wellness-journey`. Do not go to Pricing yet.

### Minute 3 to 12 | The Wellness Journey, Core of the Demo

This is the whole demo. Spend your time here.

**Step 1: Create a new patient**

> "Let me show you how a facilitator starts a new client."

Click "Log New Session," then "New Patient."

Watch the `PT-XXXXXXXX` anonymous ID generate. **Stop here.**

> "Do you see that ID? That is the only way that person exists in our system. No name. No date of birth. No contact information.
>
> We designed it this way because the identifier a practitioner needs, the patient, and the identifier a regulator or prosecutor can legally use against you are completely different things. That ID maps to a real person only in your records, outside this software, under your control.
>
> **There is nothing in our database that can be subpoenaed to identify your participants.**"

Let that land. Do not rush past it.

**Step 2: Informed Consent form**

Open the Informed Consent form.

> "Every session starts here. Timestamped. Immutable. If anyone ever asks whether a participant consented, on what date, with what information, it is here. Verifiable. Legally defensible."

*Do not specifically reference Singularism's legal situation. You do not need to. He knows.*

**Step 3: Phase 1, Set and Setting / Baseline**

Open one Phase 1 form. Navigate through a few fields.

> "Every field in this system is a controlled selection. We do not allow free text anywhere in the clinical record. Practitioners choose from validated vocabulary. This is not a policy decision. It is technically impossible to type a patient's name into a clinical field. PHI is architecturally excluded."

**Step 4: Phase 3, Integration (show outcome data)**

Navigate to Phase 3 / Integration view.

> "This is the integration phase, what happens after the session. Symptom trajectory, compliance tracking, outcome scores. This is the data that, in aggregate across a network of practitioners, becomes benchmark intelligence. Every clinic's outcomes compared to the anonymized global cohort."

---

### Minute 12 to 15 | Interaction Checker

Navigate to `/interactions`.

Search: **Psilocybin + phenelzine**

> "This is our contraindication database. 11 high-priority interactions, sourced from peer-reviewed literature with citation links. A practitioner checks this at intake, before anything else. Psilocybin plus an MAOI is an absolute contraindication. That result prevents a serious adverse event."

Show the red CONTRAINDICATED flag.

> "That is the kind of thing that, if it catches one situation in your first year, has already paid for itself."

---

### Minute 15 to 17 | Audit Log

Navigate to `/audit-logs`.

> "Every data event in the system generates an immutable timestamped log. This is the compliance backbone. If you ever need to demonstrate to a legal team or regulatory body exactly what happened, when, and in what sequence, this is the record."

---

### Minute 17 to 20 | Close

Stop sharing. Camera only.

> "That is the core. There is more, a regulatory intelligence layer, substance monographs, analytics that unlock as a clinic builds a data history. But I wanted you to see the thing that matters most: the clinical workflow and the data architecture.
>
> What are you thinking?"

**Then stop talking. Listen.**

## Handling Their Response

| They say | You say |
|---|---|
| "This is exactly what we need" | "I am glad. Let us set up another call and I will walk through how we would bring you in. I will send you something this week." |
| "What does it cost?" | "We have a founding partner structure. Let me send you the overview and we can talk through it on a second call. I would rather you have had time to digest what you just saw first." |
| "We are not ready" | "I understand. The invitation stays open. We are bringing in three founding partners before we go broad. I wanted you to have first look." |
| Questions about legal / regulatory positioning | "That is exactly why the architecture is designed the way it is. Nothing in our system can be used to identify a participant. The data defensibility is structural." |
| "Can we share this with our attorney?" | "Absolutely. We would encourage it." |

## Do Not Say

- Do not mention the $35,000 number on this call
- Do not apologize for anything being incomplete
- Do not say "beta." Say "founding partner" or "early access."
- Do not over-explain the business model. Say "Give-to-Get" and move on.
- Do not navigate to `/help`, `/billing`, or the Dashboard KPI cards
