# Advisory Board, People Strategy and Recruitment
**Prepared by:** PRODDY
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Companion to:** WO-208 (Advisory Board PRD, Clinical Vocabulary Authority)
**Classification:** Internal strategy

## Two Distinct Advisory Roles

WO-208 defined the operational structure: quorum, voting thresholds, governance workflow. This document defines the people strategy, specifically who we recruit, what they receive, and what we ask of them.

There are two functionally different advisor relationships. We should not conflate them.

---

### Role A: Clinical Vocabulary Advisor
*What WO-208 describes*

- **Function:** Review vocabulary requests from the `log_vocabulary_requests` table. Vote on what gets added to `ref_` tables. Drive the canonical clinical language of the platform.
- **Time commitment:** Approximately 1 to 2 hours per month. Async-friendly.
- **Who belongs here:** Active practitioners currently doing sessions, encountering vocabulary gaps in real practice. Their value is lived expertise, not title or seniority.
- This is a platform governance role, not a prestige role.

---

### Role B: Strategic Research Partner
*What we need right now*

- **Function:** Lend credibility, validate the research design, provide testimonials and reference rights, help shape clinical indications and outcomes frameworks.
- **Time commitment:** Two structured sessions per year plus occasional async input. Very light lift.
- **Who belongs here:** People with established credibility in their field whose involvement changes how others perceive the platform. We want this board to be diverse in expertise, not doctor-heavy.
- This is a credibility and network role, not an operational role.

**The mistake to avoid:** Asking a senior clinician who has been practicing for 20 years to vote on whether "Somatic Grounding" should be added to a dropdown. That is not the conversation that earns their involvement. Keep the roles clean.

## Target Board Composition

We want a multidisciplinary board. Clinical expertise is one voice, not the whole table.

| Seat | Expertise Area | Target Profile |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic Research Partner #1 | Psychedelic therapy practitioner, scientist | **Dr. Jason Allen** (confirmed, NIH-funded, mutual interest) |
| Strategic Research Partner #2 | Legal or regulatory, alternative medicine or religious freedom | Open, high priority given the legal landscape our clients navigate |
| Strategic Research Partner #3 | Business, operations, or health tech scaling | Open |
| Strategic Research Partner #4 | Patient advocacy or lived experience | Open |
| Clinical Vocabulary Advisor #1 | Active LMFT or LPC in psychedelic-assisted therapy | **Julian Varela** (evaluate post-demo) |
| Clinical Vocabulary Advisor #2 | Active practitioner, different modality or geography | Open |
| PPN Staff Chair | Rotating, operations | Internal |

**Design principle:** No more than two clinicians at the table. We need people who understand data, business, legal risk, and the patient experience, not just clinical protocol.

## What Strategic Research Partners Receive (Role B)

Exchange-based, no cash. The offer needs to feel meaningful.

**We give:**
- Full platform access, Research Partner tier, no cost, in perpetuity
- Formal designation: "Clinical Research Partner, PPN Portal" (title they use on their own materials, website, and presentations as they see fit)
- Co-authorship invitation on any research we publish using aggregate platform data, where they contributed to the outcomes framework
- Direct line to the founding team, not a support queue
- Early access to new features before public release

**We ask:**
- Two structured feedback sessions per year (45 minutes each, we run the agenda)
- Permission to use their name and title in our materials, with their approval on specific language
- Reference availability, willing to speak to prospective partners or investors occasionally when asked
- Honest feedback when something is not working

**We do not ask:**
- Time on operational governance (that is Role A)
- Formal legal liability (no board seat, no fiduciary role)
- Exclusivity

---

## What Clinical Vocabulary Advisors Receive (Role A)

**We give:**
- Full platform access, Research Partner tier, no cost, while active
- Designation: "Clinical Advisory Member, PPN Portal"
- Direct influence over the canonical vocabulary that every practitioner in the network uses

**We ask:**
- Monthly async vocabulary review (1 to 2 hours per month maximum)
- Quorum participation (4 of 7 required per WO-208)
- Brief rationale notes when rejecting concept requests

---

## Recruitment Sequence

**First, close the demos**

We do not make a formal advisory ask before someone has seen the product. The demo is the prerequisite. After a strong demo, the question "would you want to be formally involved?" has context. Before it, it is a cold ask.

**After demos, temperature check (Role B)**

Key points to raise informally after the demo, in our voice:
- What we are building and why their involvement matters to us
- The exchange: access plus designation plus potential co-authorship, for two sessions a year
- No board seat, no legal exposure, no exclusivity
- This is a relationship, not a contract, but we will put it in a simple one-page letter
- Ask: "Is this something you would want to be part of?"

**If yes, send a one-page Research Partner letter**

Covers:
- Designation title
- What they receive
- What we ask
- Informal, signed by both parties, kept on file
- No attorneys required

## Confirmed and Candidate Pipeline

| Contact | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Dr. Jason Allen, ND, MPH | Strategic Research Partner #1 | Confirmed interest, mutual, awaiting product demo |
| Dr. Shena Vanderploeg, ND | Evaluate after demo | Probably not the advisory board. Personal relationship has more value as a warm referral network than a formal seat. |
| Julian J. Varela, LMFT | Clinical Vocabulary Advisor (evaluate post-demo) | Active practitioner, good fit for Role A if he enters the psychedelic therapy space |
| Legal/regulatory expert | Strategic Research Partner #2 | Open, high priority given our client base's legal exposure |

---

## Open Questions

- Who do we know in the legal or religious freedom space who understands the regulatory situation our clients are navigating? That is the highest-value empty seat.
- Is there a health tech or scaling executive from our network who would round out the business perspective?
- Julian Varela, confirm his practice direction after the demo before making any advisory ask.
