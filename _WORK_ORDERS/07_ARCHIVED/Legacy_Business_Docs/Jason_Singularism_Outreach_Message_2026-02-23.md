## THE MESSAGE

---

Hey Bridger,

We're ready to show you the full platform — not the rough concept you saw before, the real thing.

We've been thinking about who we want to bring in first, and you're at the top of that list. It would mean a lot to us to walk you through it before we open it up more broadly.

Can you get 30 minutes in the next week or two? No agenda beyond showing you what we've built and hearing what you think.

— Jason

## IF BRIDGER ASKS WHAT'S CHANGED

Have this ready (spoken, not written):

> "The core workflow is fully functional — consent, session documentation, outcome tracking. The thing that's different from what you saw is that it actually runs now. Real database, real patient IDs generating, real audit trail. We want you to see it live."

## IF BRIDGER ASKS ABOUT COST / COMMITMENT

> "Let's get you through the demo first. If it's what we think it is, we have a simple structure in mind. But we'd rather show you the product than talk about it."

Do not mention a number. That happens on Call 2.
