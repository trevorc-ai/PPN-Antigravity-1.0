# WO-320: Conference & Event Word-of-Mouth Mobile Campaign

## User Prompt
"Get me a robust strategy for four different market segments we talked about mobile campaign. This is going to be a word of mouth project and it's gonna be really fun think conferences and events."

## PRODDY STRATEGY: "The Trojan Horse" Mobile Campaign

### Executive Summary
Conferences (Horizons, Wonderland, MAPS Psychedelic Science, etc.) are loud, overwhelming, and saturated with vendors selling "software." We will not sell software. We will distribute **Free Clinical Intelligence directly to their phones via QR codes.** This is a word-of-mouth (WOM) / viral loop strategy. The goal is to get practitioners using a lightweight, mobile-optimized tool on the conference floor, realizing its value, and showing it to their peers.

### The 4 Target Market Segments & Their "Hook"

#### 1. Licensed Medical Clinics (Ketamine / Spravato)
* **Their Pain:** Malpractice anxiety, standard-of-care ambiguity, and insurance audit fears.
* **The Conference Hook:** "Are you tracking CYP450 metabolic risk?"
* **The Mobile Asset:** A mobile-optimized **Drug Interaction Checker & Metabolic Risk Gauge**.
* **The WOM Loop:** Doctor A scans the QR code at a booth or networking event, checks a complex patient's med list instantly on their phone, and says to Doctor B, "Look how fast this highlights the SSRI contraindication."
* **The Call to Action (CTA):** "Claim your free clinic safety benchmark report. Enter your email."

#### 2. State-Regulated Facilitators (Oregon / Colorado)
* **Their Pain:** Drowning in compliance paperwork, high overhead, and state-mandated adverse event reporting.
* **The Conference Hook:** "Stop manually reporting adverse events to the state."
* **The Mobile Asset:** A mobile **Adverse Event / Crisis Logger** sandbox.
* **The WOM Loop:** Facilitator sees how they can log a safety event in 3 taps using coded taxonomy instead of writing a paragraph. They show their clinic owner. 
* **The CTA:** "Connect to the state registry beta."

#### 3. Entheogenic / Religious Operators (Religious Exemption)
* **Their Pain:** Existential threat of DEA raids, proving their legitimacy, and documenting "consistent screening" without creating a paper trail of PHI.
* **The Conference Hook:** "Protect your church/organization. Prove you aren't reckless."
* **The Mobile Asset:** The **Phantom Shield: Blind Vetting Scanner**.
* **The WOM Loop:** Operator scans the code and realizes they can screen participants *without collecting names or emails*. They immediately share the link in their private Signal/Telegram group of fellow guides.
* **The CTA:** "Get the Open Source Phantom Shield documentation."

#### 4. Underground / Gray Market Guides (Transitioning)
* **Their Pain:** Operating in the shadows, lack of community data, fear of "getting it wrong" with dosing or interactions, wanting to step into the light safely.
* **The Conference Hook:** "What's the actual potency of your batch?"
* **The Mobile Asset:** The **Dosage Calculator & Potency Normalizer**.
* **The WOM Loop:** Guide uses it at the conference hotel bar to calculate a normalized dose across different strains/batches. It becomes the ultimate utility tool they share with their peers.
* **The CTA:** "Join the anonymized safety registry."

### The Execution Plan (Mobile & Physical)

1. **The Physical Artifacts (No Brochures):**
   - Premium, heavy stock "Business Cards" that just have a QR code and a provocative question (e.g., "Would your documentation survive an audit? [Scan]").
   - Lanyards or enamel pins acting as "Trust Signals."

2. **The Mobile Experience:**
   - The QR code does NOT go to a marketing landing page. It drops them directly into a functioning, mobile-optimized React component (e.g., the Interaction Checker).
   - Once they get value (they run a check, they calculate a dose), a modal appears: *"Unlock the full Clinical Intelligence layer for your clinic."*

3. **The Viral Loop (Referral):**
   - "Send this Interaction Checker to your clinical director." 
   - Tracking unique session IDs to see which physical QR codes are driving the most downstream shares.

## HANDOFF
This strategy is now complete. Handing off to LEAD to architect the mobile-optimized route and MARKETER to refine the exact copy for the physical QR assets.
