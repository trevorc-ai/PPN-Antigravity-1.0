  PRODDY identified PatientProgressSummary as the highest word-of-mouth activation feature.
  The practitioner generates it; the patient takes it home; they share it with their 
  psychiatrist, their family, their friends. It's a growth engine dressed as a clinical tool.

# WO-304: PatientProgressSummary — Printable Patient-Facing Insight Report

**Priority: P0 — Highest word-of-mouth activation; generates referrals and reinforces retention**
**Location: Wellness Journey patient view → "Generate Summary" action**

## PRODDY STRATEGIC BRIEF

### Why This Before the PatientBenchmarkCard
ANALYST recommended `PatientBenchmarkCard` as the P1 patient-level feature. PRODDY disagrees on ordering for one reason: **the practitioner is the user, but the patient is the growth engine.**

The `PatientProgressSummary` is the one artifact that leaves the PPN system and enters the world. The patient holds it, shares it, and shows it to others. Every copy that circulates is marketing PPN cannot buy.

In psychedelic therapy specifically, patients are highly motivated to share positive outcomes — the stigma-reduction aspect of their experience is often part of the healing. A beautiful, professional 1-pager saying *"your depression score improved 61% over 6 weeks — clinical response achieved"* becomes something they send to their referring psychiatrist and their family doctor. Those recipients become referral leads.

### Framing Rule (CRITICAL — Clinical Language)
This document is not a medical report. It is a **progress summary**. All language must use:
- "tracks" not "diagnoses"
- "improvement in reported symptoms" not "depression is cured"
- "% change in score" not "% better"
- "clinical response threshold" not "you are healed"

## PRODUCT SPECIFICATION

### Trigger Point
- Location: Wellness Journey page → patient record → action menu → "Export Progress Summary"
- Also accessible from: Analytics page → Patient detail view (if implemented)

### Document Structure (Single Page, Print-Optimized)

#### Header Section
```
PPN CLINICAL PROGRESS SUMMARY
[Clinic Name] · Prepared: [Date]
Patient Reference: [Subject ID only — NO name, DOB, or PHI]
Clinician: [Practitioner name, credential]
```

#### Section 1: Your Journey at a Glance
- Timeline visual: horizontal milestones
  - Intake → Preparation Session → Dosing Session → Integration → Follow-up
  - Checkmarks at completed stages
  - Simple horizontal dot timeline, print-safe

#### Section 2: Symptom Score Progress
- One primary instrument (whichever has baseline + endpoint data)
- Big numbers layout:
  ```
  STARTING SCORE     →     CURRENT SCORE     →     IMPROVEMENT
      27 / 27                  11 / 27                  59%
    [PHQ-9 Baseline]       [PHQ-9 at Week 6]      [Score Reduction]
  ```
- Below: *"A reduction of 5+ points on the PHQ-9 represents a clinically meaningful change per published research criteria."*
- Plain bar: before/after visual (no complex chart — must print cleanly)

#### Section 3: What This Means
Plain English paragraph, auto-generated from score data:
```
Your responses to the PHQ-9 improved by 59% over 6 weeks of treatment. 
Based on published clinical research standards, this level of improvement 
meets the threshold for clinical response. Continued integration support 
is associated with maintaining these gains over the long term.
```
(Template-driven, not AI-generated — no risk of hallucination)

#### Section 4: Your Next Steps
- List of recommended follow-up actions from `log_integration_sessions` next_steps field
- If empty: standard follow-up recommendation: "30-day reassessment recommended"

#### Section 5: Resources (Optional — clinician can toggle)
- 3 bullet points: practitioner can add links/resources before generating
- Default: blank

#### Footer
```
CONFIDENTIAL — For Patient Use Only
This summary tracks self-reported outcomes and is not a medical diagnosis.
Generated by PPN Portal — ppn.care | [Date]
```

## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

### Print Optimization (critical)
- White background, black text
- No dark mode in print output
- Avoid backgrounds and shadows that don't print well
- Use `@media print` CSS exclusively for this component
- Target: clean on standard printer paper (US Letter / A4)

### Digital Display (secondary)
- Before printing, show the summary in a modal/slide-out panel
- User can review before generating PDF
- "Download PDF" (window.print() to PDF) and "Print" actions

### Branding
- PPN logo in header (small, top-left)
- Clinic name and logo space (top-right) — clinic can add their logo via practice settings
- Tasteful, professional — not clinical in a cold way

---

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### New Component: `src/components/wellness/PatientProgressSummary.tsx`
### New Util: `src/utils/generateProgressSummary.ts`
- Pure function: takes patient data, returns summary template object
- No AI calls — all template-driven

### Data Required
```typescript
interface ProgressSummaryData {
  subjectId: string;           // Subject_ID only — no PHI
  clinicianName: string;
  clinicName: string;
  primaryInstrument: string;   // e.g. 'PHQ-9'
  baselineScore: number;
  baselineMax: number;
  endpointScore: number;
  followupWeeks: number;
  pctImprovement: number;
  cmcThreshold: number;        // from ANALYST CMC table
  achievedResponse: boolean;   // score reduction >= CMC threshold
  completedStages: string[];   // ['intake', 'preparation', 'dosing', 'integration', 'followup']
  nextSteps: string[];
  generatedDate: string;
}
```

### Trigger Action
- `PatientJourneyPage.tsx` → add "Generate Progress Summary" button to action bar
- Opens modal showing `PatientProgressSummary` preview
- "Print / Save PDF" → `window.print()` targeting the summary element
