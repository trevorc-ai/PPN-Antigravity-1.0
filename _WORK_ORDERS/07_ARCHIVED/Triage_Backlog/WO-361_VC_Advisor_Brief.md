# WO-361_VC_Advisor_Brief.md

## PRODDY STRATEGY (VC Attorney Prep)
**Objective**: Prepare high-impact materials for an upcoming advisory session with a retired VC Attorney to maximize feedback, derisk the product, and validate our regulatory / IP strategy.

### Core Strategic Focus Areas
This advisor will naturally look for risks that would scare away a Series A Lead Investor. We need to front-run those concerns by showing we have structural answers.

#### 1. The Zero-PHI "Data Moat" Summary
- **Why it matters**: VC attorneys get extremely nervous around healthcare data due to HIPAA breaches and compliance overhead. 
- **Our Prep**: We must document how PPN uses synthetic `Subject_ID`s and strict separation of PII from clinical outcomes. We need to clearly show how this creates a defensible, proprietary dataset *without* the regulatory liability of an EHR.

#### 2. Regulatory Stance & CPOM (Corporate Practice of Medicine)
- **Why it matters**: The psychedelic space is a regulatory grey area (state vs. federal). 
- **Our Prep**: Provide a 1-pager establishing that PPN is a strict B2B software and analytics layer, not a provider of medical advice or therapy. Ask for his framework on how investors currently diligence digital health tools in the psychedelic space.

#### 3. IP & Defensibility Strategy
- **Why it matters**: Investors invest in moats. Is our tech patentable, or is our data our trade secret?
- **Our Prep**: Briefly describe our algorithmic approach (like the NNT cards or Outcome Benchmarking). Ask him: "Are we better off protecting the algorithms as trade secrets, or pursuing defensive patents?"

#### 4. The Targeted "Ask" List
VC attorney time is incredibly high-leverage. Prepare 3 specific, tough questions to send him *before* the meeting. 
Example: *"Based on your experience with digital health exits, what is the single most common legal pitfall you've seen technical founders make in their first 12 months?"*

## LEAD ARCHITECTURE
The VC Advisor strategy and materials have been generated by PRODDY.
There are a set of markdown briefs located in `docs/LEGAL/` and a live HTML pitch script at `public/advisor-demo.html`.

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Route this work order to `BUILDER` (status: `03_BUILD`) so that BUILDER can ensure these new public assets are correctly mapped in the router/build process, and deploy them to the live `ppnportal.net` domain so the founder can use the pitch script live.
