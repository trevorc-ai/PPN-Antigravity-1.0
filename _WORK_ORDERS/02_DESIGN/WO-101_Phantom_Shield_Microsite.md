# WO-101: Phantom Shield Brand & Microsite

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Design the **Grey Market** specific microsite (`/phantom-shield`). This funnel must feel like a "Sanctuary" — private, secure, and disconnected from the 'clinical' world.

## 🎨 BRAND VIBE
- **Keywords:** Stealth, Protection, Defense, Sovereignty.
- **Visuals:** Dark mode default, encryption motifs, shield iconography.
- **Key Fear:** "One bad trip ends your career."
- **Key Promise:** "Legal defense in a box."

## 📋 PAGE SECTIONS
1. **Hero**: "Don't Let One Bad Trip End Your Practice." + CTA "Protect Your Practice"
2. **The Problem**: "You are operating in the shadows. We know the risks."
3. **The Solution (Phantom Shield Suite)**:
   - Crisis Logger (Legal defense)
   - Potency Calculator (Harm reduction)
   - Cockpit Mode (Privacy)
   - Duress PIN (Security)
4. **Social Proof (Anonymous)**: "Used by 400+ guides to stay safe."
5. **Pricing**: Simple $149/mo flat rate. (Mentions 'No Data Tracking by Default').

## 📸 VISUAL TRUST EVIDENCE (CRITICAL)
**"How do I know my data is safe?"**
- **The Screenshot:** Show a mock "Database View" of a log table.
- **The Detail:**
  - Column 1: `Session_ID` (UUID)
  - Column 2: `Patient_ID` -> `****************` (Masked)
  - Column 3: `Outcome_Score` -> `8.2` (Visible)
  - *Caption:* "What our servers see vs. What you see. Your client names never leave your device."
- **Why:** Showing a "boring" table with masked fields creates more trust than 1000 words of copy about "AES-256 encryption".

## 🗣️ MESSAGING RULES (STRICT)
- **NO:** "Police", "Law Enforcement", "Illegal", "Underground". (Implies criminality).
- **NO:** "Patient Name" (Implies we collect it). Use "Patient ID" or "Client Key".
- **YES:** "Zero-Knowledge Architecture", "Sovereignty", "Privacy", "Subpoena-proof".
- **APPROVED COPY:** *"This system is built on 'Zero-Knowledge Architecture.' That means even PPN cannot see your client's identity. Even if PPN were subpoenaed tomorrow, we literally have nothing to give them but a string of random numbers and a blood pressure reading. You hold the key, not us."* (Grade 8 Reading Level).
