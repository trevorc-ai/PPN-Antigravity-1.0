# WO-226: Landing Page — Full Redesign v2 (REPEAT)

## User Prompt (verbatim)
"I provided extensive feedback on the landing page, and then was asked about it again later in the same chat, and updates still were never made. The new copy changes are good, but the design is still very flawed."

## Prior Work Order
This was previously scoped as WO-222. Design feedback was collected, acknowledged, and routed to PRODDY+MARKETER+DESIGNER — but the redesign was never executed.

## Known Issues (from user VoC, multiple sessions)
- ALL CAPS in header: "PPN PORTAL", "CLINICAL INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM", "AUGMENTED INTELLIGENCE FOR PSYCHEDELIC WELLNESS PRACTITIONERS", "NOTICE:..." — all must be sentence/title case
- Background stars animation looks low-quality ("bobbing back-and-forth")
- Color palette inconsistency between sections and footer gradient
- No login button in the hero
- Inconsistent font sizing and formatting throughout
- "Is your clinical workflow fragmented?" section has visible grid lines, different background, unclear purpose
- Sections below hero feel crowded and bland
- Dead links and placeholder buttons throughout
- "Supporting veterans" section is buried at the very bottom — no narrative flow
- No clear CTA or story arc from hero to conversion
- The word "network" should be replaced with "alliance" in all copy

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No ALL CAPS text except intentional acronyms (PPN, MDMA, etc.)
- [ ] Consistent color system matching app interior
- [ ] Login/Sign In button visible in hero or nav
- [ ] All CTAs link to real destinations
- [ ] Clear narrative flow: problem → solution → proof → CTA
- [ ] "network" → "alliance" in all body copy
- [ ] No fabricated statistics

## LEAD NOTES
Route to PRODDY for PRD first, then DESIGNER for mockup, then BUILDER to implement.
