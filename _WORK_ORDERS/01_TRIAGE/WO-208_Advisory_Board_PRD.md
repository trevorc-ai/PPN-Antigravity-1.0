## Context

From `turning_point.md`: The advisory board is not a future idea — it IS the GTM strategy.

**People already standing by (from USER's network):**
- **Dr. Jason Allen** — NIH/research pedigree = IRB credibility + publication pipeline
- **Sarah Honeycutt** — Oregon facilitator = first real practitioner user, beta tester, ref_ vocabulary validator
- **John Turner / Trippingly** — Retreat operator = site-level customer, different use case
- **Bridger Lee Jensen** — Utah policy = emerging legal market intelligence, regulatory alignment

The ask is simple: "Would you spend 30 minutes reviewing our clinical vocabulary and telling us what's missing?" Their first job is validating the ref_ tables.

## PRODDY Deliverables

1. **Advisory Board Structure PRD**
   - Number of seats (suggest: 7-9)
   - Composition mix (practitioners / researchers / patient advocates / international member)
   - Compensation model (equity / honorarium / recognition only)
   - Term length and meeting cadence

2. **Vocabulary Authority Charter**
   - Formal definition of the 3-tier threshold (3/7/15 sites)
   - Approval quorum requirements
   - Process for safety-critical fast-path entries
   - How advisory board members receive credit in the system

3. **Recruitment Sequence Brief**
   - Hand to MARKETER for actual email sequences
   - One-page "what you're joining" document
   - The specific ask for the founding members

4. **Launch Positioning**
   - "PPN Portal launches with clinical advisory board of leading psychedelic-assisted therapy practitioners"
   - This is the press release hook
   - Advisory members get visible badge in system + "Advisory Member" marker on benchmarking charts

## Competitive Note

Safar has both a Business Advisory Board and a Clinical Advisory Board. Ours must be seated BEFORE launch — not promised AT launch.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PRD covers all 4 deliverables above
- [ ] LEAD reviewed and approved architecture implications
- [ ] MARKETER has brief to write recruitment sequences
- [ ] USER has confirmed: seat count, composition, and compensation model
