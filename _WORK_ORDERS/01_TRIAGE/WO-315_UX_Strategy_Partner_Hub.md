# WO-315: UX Strategy, Visual Showcase & Partner Hub Fixes

## User Prompt
"I'D LIKE YOU TO GIVE THE SIDEBAR AND THE COMPONENT SHOWCASE A CLOSER LOOK TO SEE HOW WE MIGHT BETTER ORGANIZE THE SIDE BAR AND OTHER WAYS FOR USERS TO DISCOVER ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY AND FEATURES OF THE SITE. FOR INSTANCE, ONE THING COMES TO MIND WE HAVE NOW A MOBILE ONLY PATIENT BRIDGE that should not be the second item on the sidebar for desktop users. We also added an OCR feature. Apple Watch integration is coming, etc...

Also, we gave the main landing page a little bit of extra design touch. But I feel like we could do a better job of actually showcasing what the users are going to get and the transformation it will bring for them, but represented visually...

The checkout page, and most other work orders are almost all done and implemented. So we're going to need to update the user manual/help page guide... Can we have the agents design really robust help pages? We should probably also update the partner hub and Jason's demo page... Is that something we can do easily? If so, let me know how I can help.

Oh, and please fix the CTA button at the bottom of the partner hub."

## LEAD ARCHITECTURE
