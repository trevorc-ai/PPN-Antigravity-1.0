## User Request (Verbatim)

> "ALL Wellness Journey Phase 1 Slideouts are not retaining and re-displaying previously entered data when user clicks "Amend" to any card on the Phase 1 screen."

## CUE Summary

All Phase 1 slideout panels in the Wellness Journey fail to pre-populate with previously saved data when the user clicks "Amend" on any Phase 1 card. This affects every slideout in Phase 1, meaning no previously entered data is restored for review or editing.

## Open Questions

None — request was clear.

## Out of Scope

- Phase 2 or Phase 3 slideout behavior
- Changes to how data is saved (only re-display/pre-population is affected)
- Any new Phase 1 fields or cards not currently in production
