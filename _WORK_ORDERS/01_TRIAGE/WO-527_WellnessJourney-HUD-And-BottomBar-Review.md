## User Request (Verbatim)

> "Wellness Journey phase 1 needs a compact HUD below the cards, above the Documentation confirmation, reflecting the entries made in the slideouts. Wellness Journey all three phases have a 3-div wide container at the bottom with fake static data; Send to Proddy for recommendations on HUD to enhance UX, or deletion. Request Proddy provide suggestions for both, notify LEAD and USER; USER to confirm action plan before build."

## CUE Summary

Two distinct UX items are in scope for Phase 1–3 of the Wellness Journey. Item 1: a compact HUD strip (below workflow cards, above the proceed/confirmation button) in Phase 1 that surfaces slideout form entries as live read-back data. Item 2: all three phases contain a 3-column bottom container populated with fake/static data — PRODDY must recommend whether to keep (and upgrade with real data) or delete entirely. No build may begin until USER confirms PRODDY's recommended action plan.

## Open Questions

None — request was clear.

## Out of Scope

- Any changes to the slideout panel forms themselves
- Phase 2 Live Session HUD / session timer (separate feature)
- Analytics pages or any other non-Wellness-Journey screens
