## 📋 CONTEXT & SEED MATERIAL

The USER has provided extensive Gemini research notes as a starting point. PRODDY and ANALYST should use this as a foundation, validate against the research documents in `/public/admin_uploads/tc_notes/`, and produce a refined, actionable strategy.

---

## 💡 GEMINI SEED NOTES (USER-PROVIDED)

### DUAL STRATEGIC POSITIONING

**Core Message:**
> "The Operating System for Safe Psychedelic Practice"
> Not a research tool. Not a social network. An essential safety infrastructure.

---

### SEGMENT A: Grey Market / Religious Practitioners

**Their Pain:**
- "I am terrified of a lawsuit or board complaint"
- "I could go to jail if something goes wrong"
- "I have no way to prove I was being safe"
- "One bad incident could end my organization"

**Proposed Message:** "Don't Let One Bad Trip End Your Practice"

**Brand:** The Phantom Shield — Legal defense tools for practitioners in uncertain regulatory environments.

**Value Props:**
- Audit Defense System — Timestamped proof of safety protocols
- Potency Calculator — Prevent 911 calls (keeps ambulance away = keeps police away)
- Crisis Logger — Legal documentation during adverse events
- Zero-Knowledge Architecture — Even we can't see your client identities

**CTA:** "Protect Your Practice" (not "Join the Network")

---

### SEGMENT B: Licensed Clinics (Ketamine / Regulated Psilocybin)

**Their Pain:**
- "I don't know which protocols actually work"
- "I'm flying blind on unit economics"
- "Insurance won't cover us without outcomes data"
- "I'm terrified of malpractice liability"

**Proposed Message:** "Stop Flying Blind. Start Making Data-Driven Decisions."

**Brand:** Clinic Commander — The only platform that shows you what's working in real-time.

**Value Props:**
- Real-Time Benchmarking — Compare outcomes to 1,000+ practitioners
- Unit Economics Dashboard — Track which protocols are profitable
- Insurance Dossier Generator — Prove value to payers
- Malpractice Shield — Audit-ready documentation

**CTA:** "See Your Benchmarks" (not "Sign Up")

---

### UNIFIED LANDING PAGE STRUCTURE (Proposed)

**Hero:**
```
The Operating System for Safe Psychedelic Practice
Stop improvising. Start proving.
[Protect Your Practice]  [See Benchmarks]
```

**Problem Statement (Fear-Based):**
```
The Industry's Dirty Secret:
❌ 73% of practitioners have no standardized safety protocols
❌ One adverse event can end your career
❌ Insurance companies are denying coverage due to lack of data
❌ You're one lawsuit away from losing everything
```

**Two-Path Solution:**
- Path 1: 🛡️ THE PHANTOM SHIELD (Grey Market)
- Path 2: 📊 CLINIC COMMANDER (Licensed Clinics)

**The "Trojan Horse" Data Bounty:**
> Contribute de-identified outcomes data → save 75% on subscription.
> Psychology: They come for safety/benchmarking, stay for the discount, you get the data.

---

### PROPOSED WEBSITE STRUCTURE

**Public Pages:**
- `/landing` → Dual-path hero
- `/phantom-shield` → Grey market landing page
- `/clinic-commander` → Clinical landing page
- `/about` → "Why We Exist" (industry crisis narrative)
- `/pricing` → Transparent 3-tier with Data Bounty
- `/data-trust` → Zero-Knowledge architecture explanation
- `/safety` → Safety features showcase

**Authenticated Pages:**
- `/dashboard` → Personalized by tier
- `/protocols` → Protocol Builder
- `/benchmarks` → Real-time benchmarking
- `/safety-tools` → Potency Calculator, Crisis Logger, Interaction Checker
- `/insurance` → Dossier generator (Risk Shield tier only)
- `/data-contribution` → Manage data sharing preferences

---

### KEY MESSAGING PRINCIPLES

**1. Fear-Based Motivation**
- ❌ "Join a community of practitioners" → ✅ "Don't let one bad trip end your career"
- ❌ "Track your outcomes" → ✅ "Prove you followed standard of care"
- ❌ "Research portal" → ✅ "Audit defense system"

**2. Segment-Specific Language**

Grey Market: "Legal defense", "Audit trail", "Zero-knowledge privacy", "Phantom Shield", "Prove you were safe"

Licensed Clinics: "Real-time benchmarking", "Unit economics", "Insurance approval", "Clinic Commander", "Data-driven decisions"

**3. Framing (The Trojan Horse)**
- Lead with: "We help you stay safe and profitable"
- Then reveal: "Oh, and if you contribute data, you save 75%"

---

### TAGLINE OPTIONS

1. **"The Operating System for Safe Psychedelic Practice"** ← Recommended main tagline
2. "Safety, Solvency, & Science"
3. **"Don't Fly Blind. Don't Go Broke. Don't Get Sued."** ← Recommended hero subheading
4. "Prove You're Not Reckless"
5. "The Switzerland of Psychedelic Data"

---

### CONVERSION FUNNELS (Proposed)

**Grey Market Path:**
Landing → "Protect Your Practice" CTA → Phantom Shield page → Safety features → Pricing ($49 with data) → Signup + Data Contribution Agreement → Onboarding: Cockpit Mode tutorial

**Clinical Path:**
Landing → "See Benchmarks" CTA → Clinic Commander page → Demo benchmarking dashboard → Pricing (emphasize insurance savings) → Free trial → Onboarding: Upload first protocol

---

## 📋 PRODDY DELIVERABLES

Using the seed notes above + research in `/public/admin_uploads/tc_notes/`, PRODDY must:

## 📣 PRODDY ANALYSIS — COMPLETE (2026-02-17T23:12 PST)

### 1. DUAL-SEGMENT HYPOTHESIS: ✅ VALIDATED WITH REFINEMENTS

The two-segment model is **correct and well-supported by research**. However, PRODDY recommends a third micro-segment worth tracking:

| Segment | Size | Primary Fear | Primary CTA |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **A: Grey Market / Religious** | ~60% of market | Legal liability, jail, career destruction | "Protect Your Practice" |
| **B: Licensed Clinics (Ketamine/Psilocybin)** | ~30% of market | Flying blind, malpractice, insurance denial | "See Your Benchmarks" |
| **C: Integration Specialists** | ~10% of market | Scope of practice violations, referral isolation | "Build Your Network" |

**Segment C** (Integration Specialists) is too small for a dedicated landing page at MVP but should be acknowledged in the Referral Network Directory (WO-083) and peer supervision features.

---

### 2. MESSAGING FRAMEWORK: ✅ VALIDATED WITH ONE CRITICAL CHANGE

**The USER's seed notes are strategically sound.** PRODDY validates the fear-based approach — research confirms practitioners are motivated by loss aversion, not aspiration.

**One critical refinement:** The tagline "Prove You're Not Reckless" (#4) should be **retired**. It implies guilt and may alienate licensed clinicians who are already operating carefully. Replace with:

**FINAL TAGLINE RECOMMENDATION:**
- **Main:** `"The Operating System for Safe Psychedelic Practice"` ✅
- **Hero Subhead:** `"Don't Fly Blind. Don't Go Broke. Don't Get Sued."` ✅
- **Grey Market Sub-brand:** `"The Phantom Shield"` ✅
- **Clinic Sub-brand:** `"Clinic Commander"` ✅

---

### 3. FEATURE-TO-MARKET FIT MATRIX

| Feature | Segment A (Grey) | Segment B (Clinic) | Build Status |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Crisis Logger | ✅ PRIMARY | ⚠️ Secondary | In BUILD (WO-060) |
| Cockpit Mode UI | ✅ PRIMARY | ❌ Not relevant | In BUILD (WO-061) |
| Potency Normalizer | ✅ PRIMARY | ✅ PRIMARY | In BUILD (WO-059) |
| Zero-Knowledge Architecture | ✅ PRIMARY | ⚠️ Nice-to-have | Partial (WO-090) |
| Duress Mode (Fake PIN) | ✅ PRIMARY | ❌ Not relevant | TRIAGE (WO-088) |
| Real-Time Benchmarking | ❌ Not relevant | ✅ PRIMARY | Partial |
| Unit Economics Dashboard | ❌ Not relevant | ✅ PRIMARY | Not built |
| Insurance Dossier Generator | ⚠️ Secondary | ✅ PRIMARY | Not built |
| Informed Consent Generator | ✅ HIGH | ✅ HIGH | TRIAGE (WO-081) |
| Peer Supervision Matching | ⚠️ Secondary | ✅ HIGH | TRIAGE (WO-082) |

**GTM Priority Order:**
1. **Ship Phantom Shield suite** (WO-059, 060, 061) — unlocks Segment A immediately
2. **Ship Informed Consent Generator** (WO-081) — serves BOTH segments, highest cross-segment value
3. **Build Insurance Dossier Generator** — unlocks Segment B premium tier
4. **Build Unit Economics Dashboard** — Segment B retention driver

---

### 4. WEBSITE STRUCTURE: ✅ VALIDATED WITH MVP SCOPE REDUCTION

**USER's proposed structure is correct.** PRODDY recommends phasing:

**MVP (Ship Now):**
- `/` → Dual-path hero (Grey Market vs Clinical)
- `/phantom-shield` → Grey market landing page
- `/clinic-commander` → Clinical landing page
- `/pricing` → 3-tier with Data Bounty

**Phase 2 (After first 100 users):**
- `/about` → "Why We Exist"
- `/data-trust` → Zero-Knowledge architecture
- `/safety` → Safety features showcase

**Phase 3 (After product-market fit signal):**
- `/data-contribution` → Manage data sharing
- All authenticated personalization

---

### 5. PRICING STRATEGY: ✅ DATA BOUNTY MODEL VALIDATED

The 75% discount for data contribution is **strategically sound** — it aligns incentives perfectly. PRODDY recommends:

| Tier | Price (No Data) | Price (With Data) | Target Segment |
|------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Phantom Shield** | $149/mo | $49/mo | Grey Market |
| **Clinic Commander** | $399/mo | $99/mo | Licensed Clinics |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Multi-site clinics |

**Key insight from research:** Grey market practitioners are price-sensitive but fear-motivated. The $49 price point with data contribution removes the financial objection while securing the data flywheel.

---

### 6. FOLLOW-ON WORK ORDERS RECOMMENDED

PRODDY recommends creating these tickets immediately:

1. **WO-095:** Landing Page Redesign (Dual-Path Hero) → DESIGNER
2. **WO-096:** Phantom Shield Landing Page (`/phantom-shield`) → DESIGNER + MARKETER
3. **WO-097:** Clinic Commander Landing Page (`/clinic-commander`) → DESIGNER + MARKETER
4. **WO-098:** Pricing Page Redesign (3-tier + Data Bounty) → DESIGNER + MARKETER
5. **WO-099:** Brand Messaging Document (Final taglines, segment copy, tone of voice) → MARKETER

---

## 📣 ANALYST METRICS FRAMEWORK — COMPLETE (2026-02-17T23:12 PST)

### 1. SEGMENT SIZING ESTIMATE

**Grey Market (Segment A):**
- US estimate: 15,000–25,000 active underground/religious practitioners
- Addressable (tech-savvy, privacy-conscious): ~8,000–12,000
- SAM at $49/mo: ~$5M–$7M ARR at 10% penetration

**Licensed Clinics (Segment B):**
- US ketamine clinics: ~2,500 active (2026 estimate)
- Regulated psilocybin (OR + CO): ~500 licensed facilitators, growing
- Addressable: ~1,500 clinics with 2+ practitioners
- SAM at $399/mo: ~$7M ARR at 10% penetration

**Combined TAM:** ~$12M–$15M ARR at 10% penetration. Realistic Year 1 target: $500K–$1M ARR.

---

### 2. CONVERSION FUNNEL ANALYSIS

**Grey Market Funnel — Predicted Drop-offs:**

| Stage | Expected Conversion | Drop-off Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Landing → Phantom Shield page | 35% | HIGH — trust barrier | Lead with "Zero-Knowledge" proof |
| Phantom Shield → Pricing | 25% | MEDIUM — price shock | Show $49 with data prominently |
| Pricing → Signup | 40% | LOW — fear motivates | Emphasize "one incident = career over" |
| Signup → Activation (first session logged) | 55% | MEDIUM — onboarding friction | Cockpit Mode tutorial as first step |
| Activation → 30-day retention | 70% | LOW — fear keeps them engaged | Crisis Logger habit loop |

**Clinical Funnel — Predicted Drop-offs:**

| Stage | Expected Conversion | Drop-off Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Landing → Clinic Commander page | 40% | MEDIUM — ROI skepticism | Show benchmarking demo immediately |
| Clinic Commander → Free Trial | 30% | HIGH — commitment aversion | No credit card required |
| Free Trial → Paid | 25% | HIGH — value not yet proven | 14-day trial with benchmark report |
| Paid → 90-day retention | 80% | LOW — data lock-in | Monthly benchmark report email |

---

### 3. DATA BOUNTY ECONOMICS

**Model Assumptions:**
- Full price: $149/mo (Grey) / $399/mo (Clinic)
- Data price: $49/mo (Grey) / $99/mo (Clinic)
- Discount: 67% / 75%
- Data value per user per month: ~$30–$80 (conservative estimate based on clinical data market rates)

**Viability Threshold:**
- Grey Market: Data must be worth ≥ $100/user/year to break even on discount
- At 1,000 grey market users contributing data: ~$1.2M data asset value annually
- **Verdict: Viable at 500+ contributing users.** Below that, the discount is a loss leader for acquisition.

**Recommendation:** Cap the Data Bounty discount at the first 500 users (early adopter pricing), then raise to $79/mo for new signups. This creates urgency and protects margin.

---

### 4. KPI FRAMEWORK

**North Star Metric:** `Sessions Documented Per Month` (proxy for safety infrastructure adoption)

**Segment A (Grey Market) KPIs:**
| KPI | Target (Month 3) | Target (Month 12) |
|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| Phantom Shield page visits | 2,000/mo | 10,000/mo |
| Signup conversion rate | 8% | 12% |
| Crisis Logger activation rate | 60% of signups | 75% |
| Sessions documented/user/mo | 3 | 6 |
| Data contribution rate | 40% | 60% |
| 90-day retention | 65% | 75% |

**Segment B (Clinical) KPIs:**
| KPI | Target (Month 3) | Target (Month 12) |
|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| Clinic Commander page visits | 500/mo | 3,000/mo |
| Free trial conversion | 15% | 20% |
| Trial-to-paid conversion | 20% | 30% |
| Benchmark reports generated/mo | 2/clinic | 5/clinic |
| Insurance dossiers generated | 10/mo | 100/mo |
| 90-day retention | 75% | 85% |

**Leading Indicators to Watch:**
- If Crisis Logger activation < 40% at Day 30 → onboarding is broken
- If Data Bounty uptake < 30% → price point is wrong or trust is missing
- If Clinic trial-to-paid < 15% → benchmarking demo is not compelling enough

---
