## User Request (Verbatim)

> "Wellness Journey should only display 'QT Interval Tracker' container when "Ibogaine" is selected as a substance, otherwise auto-hide. But ALSO add a manual show/hide toggle just in case practitioner wants to get baseline reading prior to adding an 'Ibogaine' dose to an existing treatment."

## CUE Summary

The QT Interval Tracker container in the Wellness Journey should be hidden by default and automatically revealed only when Ibogaine is selected as the active substance. Additionally, a manual show/hide toggle must be added so a practitioner can surface the tracker independently of substance selection (e.g., to capture a baseline reading before logging an Ibogaine dose).

## Open Questions

None — request was clear.

## Out of Scope

- Any changes to the QT Interval Tracker's internal fields, layout, or data logic.
- Any changes to how substance selection itself works.
- Persisting the manual toggle state to the database.
