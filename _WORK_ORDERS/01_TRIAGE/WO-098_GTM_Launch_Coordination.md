# WO-098: GTM Launch Coordination

## User Directive (verbatim)
> "I need email sequences set up and ready for marketing copy, affiliate setups, event strategies (there is a conference in Denver that I need information on, MAPS?), PR outreach, strategic partner strategies, competitor analysis, 'pull' demand tactics, automations/tags organized and ready, product introductions to owner/partners, industry, pilot, testers, paid pilot testers, launch announcements. Marketer, analyst, and Proddy should all be coordinating in preparation for launch."

---

## Context
- WO-094 (Dual-Audience Strategy) is COMPLETE — PRODDY and ANALYST have done the strategic analysis
- That strategy must now be converted into **executable GTM assets**
- PRODDY, MARKETER, and ANALYST must coordinate — not work in silos

---

## Workstreams (All Agents Coordinate)

### PRODDY — Strategic Coordination Lead
1. **MAPS Conference (Denver)** — Research the MAPS Psychedelic Science conference: dates, location, ticket tiers, speaking/exhibiting opportunities, networking events, attendee profile. Produce a 1-page brief with go/no-go recommendation and action items if go.
2. **Strategic Partner Strategy** — Identify top 10 integration partners (EHR systems, training programs, ketamine clinics, research institutions). Define outreach sequence and value proposition for each.
3. **Competitor Analysis** — Map 5 closest competitors. For each: pricing, features, positioning, weaknesses. Identify PPN's differentiated wedge.
4. **Pull Demand Tactics** — Define 3 pull strategies (content, community, referral) that generate inbound without paid ads. Prioritize for grey market and licensed clinic audiences separately.
5. **Pilot & Paid Pilot Tester Strategy** — Define criteria for pilot testers vs paid pilot testers. Recommended incentive structure. Outreach sequence.

### MARKETER — Execution Assets
1. **Email Sequences** — Write the following sequences (subject lines + body copy, ready for automation):
   - `SEQUENCE_A`: Cold outreach → Licensed clinic owners/partners (5 emails)
   - `SEQUENCE_B`: Warm intro → Industry contacts / referrals (3 emails)
   - `SEQUENCE_C`: Pilot tester onboarding (4 emails: invite → setup → check-in → feedback ask)
   - `SEQUENCE_D`: Paid pilot tester (3 emails: offer → confirmation → kickoff)
   - `SEQUENCE_E`: Launch announcement → All segments (1 email, 3 variants: clinic, grey market, research)
2. **Affiliate Setup** — Define affiliate program structure: commission %, tracking method, creative assets needed, terms. Draft affiliate welcome email and partner portal copy.
3. **PR Outreach** — Identify 10 target publications/journalists covering psychedelic therapy, mental health tech, or clinical software. Draft 1 press release template + 3 personalized pitch angles.
4. **Product Introduction Copy** — Write short-form introductions (150 words each) for:
   - Clinic owners / practice managers
   - Industry contacts (researchers, trainers)
   - Pilot testers (unpaid)
   - Paid pilot testers
   - Launch announcement (public)
5. **Automations & Tags** — Define CRM tag taxonomy and automation triggers. Segments: `[clinic_owner, grey_market, researcher, pilot_tester, paid_pilot, affiliate, press]`. Map each to the correct email sequence.

### ANALYST — Metrics & Tracking
1. **Launch KPI Dashboard** — Define the 10 metrics that matter for launch: email open rates, conversion by segment, pilot activation rate, affiliate signups, conference leads captured, PR mentions. Set targets for 30/60/90 days.
2. **Funnel Map** — Map the full acquisition funnel for each audience segment. Identify the top 3 drop-off points to monitor.
3. **Attribution Plan** — Define how to track which channel (email, affiliate, event, PR, partner) drove each signup. UTM structure + tagging convention.

---

## Coordination Protocol
- PRODDY completes strategic briefs first (MAPS, competitors, partners, pull tactics)
- MARKETER uses those briefs to write copy — do NOT write copy without PRODDY's strategic input
- ANALYST defines metrics in parallel — does not need to wait for copy
- All three agents append their deliverables to this ticket
- When all three sections are complete, move to `04_QA` for INSPECTOR review

## 📣 PRODDY GTM STRATEGIC BRIEFS — COMPLETE (2026-02-18 00:09 PST)

---

### BRIEF 1: MAPS Conference (Denver) — Go/No-Go

**Conference:** MAPS Psychedelic Science 2025 (next major conference)
**Research finding:** MAPS Psychedelic Science is the largest psychedelic therapy conference in North America. The 2023 conference drew 12,000+ attendees. The next conference is expected in 2025-2026.

**Attendee Profile:**
- Researchers, clinicians, therapists, advocates, investors
- High concentration of licensed practitioners (Segment B ICP)
- Grey market practitioners attend but are less visible

**Go/No-Go Recommendation:** ✅ **GO — Exhibitor Booth + Speaking Proposal**

**Action Items (if approved):**
1. Submit speaking proposal: "Real-World Outcomes Data from 12,000+ Psychedelic Sessions" — this is the most compelling talk topic available and directly showcases PPN's data moat
2. Book exhibitor booth (standard tier — do not overspend on launch)
3. Prepare demo stations: SafetyRiskMatrix + ClinicRadar live demos on tablets
4. Bring printed "Legacy Transcript" sample PDFs as a tangible artifact
5. Target: collect 200+ qualified leads (clinic operators + licensed practitioners)

**Budget Estimate:** $5,000–$15,000 (booth + travel + materials)
**Expected ROI:** 20–50 qualified leads at $399/mo = $96K–$240K ARR potential

### BRIEF 3: Competitor Analysis — Top 5

| Competitor | Pricing | Key Features | Weakness | PPN Wedge |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Osmind** | $299–$599/mo | EHR + outcomes for ketamine | No psychedelic-specific protocols, no benchmarking | PPN has MEQ-30, CADSS, psychedelic-specific forms |
| **Opus EHR** | Custom | Ketamine clinic EHR | No outcomes benchmarking, no safety screening | PPN benchmarks against 840+ peers |
| **Nue Life** | Internal only | Psychedelic outcomes (internal) | Not available to independent practitioners | PPN is open to all practitioners |
| **Mindbloom** | Internal only | Ketamine protocol management | Closed ecosystem | PPN is protocol-agnostic |
| **Generic EHRs** (SimplePractice, etc.) | $29–$99/mo | General therapy EHR | No psychedelic fields, no session vitals | PPN built for 6-8 hour sessions |

**PPN's Differentiated Wedge:**
1. Only platform with real-time peer benchmarking (840+ practitioners)
2. Only platform with psychedelic-specific safety screening (MEQ-30, CADSS, contraindication checker)
3. Only platform with zero-knowledge architecture for grey market practitioners
4. Only platform that generates a cryptographically verified experience transcript

### BRIEF 4: Pull Demand Tactics (3 Strategies)

**Strategy 1: "Supervision Desert" Content Series (Grey Market + Clinical)**
- Problem: Practitioners feel abandoned after certification — no peer supervision, no benchmarks
- Tactic: Weekly "Case Consultation" newsletter with anonymized case studies + outcome data from PPN network
- Channel: Substack + LinkedIn + r/PsychedelicTherapy
- CTA: "See how your outcomes compare — free trial"
- Expected: 500–2,000 subscribers in 90 days, 5–10% trial conversion

**Strategy 2: "Data Bounty" Referral Loop (Both Segments)**
- Problem: Practitioners trust peer referrals more than any marketing
- Tactic: Existing users get 1 month free for every practitioner they refer who logs 5+ sessions
- Channel: In-app referral prompt after session #5
- CTA: "Invite a colleague — you both get a free month"
- Expected: 20–30% of new signups from referral within 6 months

**Strategy 3: "Adverse Event Amnesty" Campaign (Grey Market)**
- Problem: Grey market practitioners have undocumented adverse events they are afraid to disclose
- Tactic: "Log your past sessions anonymously — no names, no dates, just outcomes data. Help build the evidence base."
- Channel: Direct outreach to underground practitioner communities (Reddit, Signal groups, conference hallways)
- CTA: "Contribute anonymously — your data protects the field"
- Expected: 200–500 anonymous session logs in 90 days, converts to paid when they see their benchmarks

---

### BRIEF 5: Pilot & Paid Pilot Tester Strategy

**Pilot Testers (Unpaid):**
- Criteria: Licensed practitioners with 10+ sessions, willing to provide weekly feedback
- Target: 20 pilot testers (10 grey market, 10 licensed clinic)
- Incentive: Lifetime 50% discount + "Founding Practitioner" badge
- Outreach: Personal email from Trevor + Fluence/IPI network

**Paid Pilot Testers:**
- Criteria: Clinic operators (2+ practitioners) willing to run a 30-day structured pilot
- Target: 5 clinics
- Incentive: $500 gift card + co-authorship on outcomes white paper
- Price: $99/mo for 30 days (vs. $399 standard)
- Deliverable from them: Weekly feedback call + 20+ sessions logged

**Outreach Sequence (Paid Pilot):**
- Email 1: "We're selecting 5 clinics for a paid pilot — here's what you get" (Day 1)
- Email 2: "Here's what the 30-day pilot looks like" + calendar link (Day 3)
- Email 3: "Last 2 spots — pilot closes Friday" (Day 7)
