# Demo Pipeline — Three Doctors + Bridger
**Prepared by:** PRODDY  
**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Classification:** Internal — Jason's reference document

This document profiles all four warm contacts waiting for a demo and maps the right approach for each conversation.

---

## CONTACT 1: Bridger Lee Jensen
**Organization:** Singularism  
**Location:** Orem / Provo, Utah  
**Title:** Founder  
**Background:** Master of Psychological Counseling. Founder of what his LinkedIn calls "the first and only federally recognized entheogenic religion with legal protections for the ceremonial use of psilocybin mushrooms." Active federal litigation (anti-suit injunction protecting religious psilocybin ceremonies — Judge Jill Parrish, August 2025).

**Relationship:** Jason's close connection. Has seen early concept demo. Expressed interest in beta access.

**Proposed Structure:** Commercial — Design Partner Agreement  
**Price:** Open at $35,000 / 12 months. Walk to $25,000. Floor: $22,000.

**Demo Angle:** Lead with the anonymous Subject ID and the fact that participant records cannot be physically seized because they don't exist as named documents. His LinkedIn tells you he sees himself as a pioneer and precedent-setter — mirror that framing back. He's not buying software; he's building the data infrastructure his movement will run on.

**Primary Demo Features:** Consent flow → Subject ID generation → Audit log → Phase 3 outcome data  
**Do NOT show:** Dashboard KPI cards (mock data), Help Center, Billing

**Key line for Jason to deliver:**
> *"There is nothing in our database that can be subpoenaed to identify your participants. The record that connects a Subject ID to a real person lives only in your records — outside this software, under your control."*

**Status:** Outreach message drafted. Demo script ready. Agreement drafted. Pre-demo seeder (WO-405) must complete before demo date is set.

## CONTACT 2: Dr. Jason Allen, ND, MPH
**Organization:** Reasonable Remedies  
**Location:** [TBD]  
**Title:** Naturopathic Physician  
**Background:** ~20 years clinical practice — including **20 years of active psychedelic therapy practice conducted under the radar.** He is a crusader: mission-driven, deeply experienced, and personally acquainted with the risks of operating without institutional protection. Advanced training in public health, epidemiology, and clinical research.

**Relationship:** Direct — user has already had a meeting with him. He is waiting to see the product.

**Proposed Structure:** Re-evaluate. Originally flagged as Advisory/Research Partner (non-cash). Given 20 years of active practice and direct relationship, he may warrant a **Founding Partner commercial offer** — or a hybrid where platform access is exchange-based but includes a formal advisory role that carries weight in investor/partner conversations.

**Recommended:** Have an honest conversation about what structure serves him best. He has more to gain from PPN than a random clinic — 20 years of undocumented outcomes data is a dataset he may finally be able to structure and analyze. That's a genuine value proposition, not just software access.

**Demo Angle:** This is the most nuanced of all four conversations. He is simultaneously:
1. A practitioner who has lived the compliance risk personally for two decades
2. A scientist who understands research design and data quality
3. A true believer who has kept the work alive when no infrastructure existed

Do NOT give him the standard compliance pitch — he is not buying protection, he already knows the risk. Give him **the vision of what documentation finally done right makes possible.**

Key framing:
> *"You've been doing this work for twenty years without a system designed for it. This is what that system looks like. And everything you've seen and documented over those twenty years — if it's ever recorded here going forward, it becomes part of a dataset that could actually change the clinical conversation."*

The anonymous Subject ID and audit trail will land for him — but lead with the **research and data quality story**, not the legal defense story. He chose the risk. What he's waiting for is infrastructure that makes the work matter beyond his individual practice.

**Primary Demo Features:** Wellness Journey (full arc, show the structured data collection) → Analytics / Benchmark Intelligence → "What We Collect" schema document (WO-406)  
**Key moment:** Show him the PHQ-9 trajectory chart in Phase 3 and say: *"This is what 500 practitioners collecting this data in the same structure produces at the network level."*

**Status:** Warm — user has met with him. He is waiting to see the product. Demo should be scheduled promptly after Singularism. Outreach is a simple follow-up from the user: *"We're ready to show you. When can you get 30 minutes?"*

## CONTACT 3: Dr. Shena Vanderploeg, ND
**Organization:** Flow Wellness  
**Location:** [TBD]  
**Title:** Naturopathic Doctor  
**Background:** Specializes in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) and testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). Focus on hormonal balance and overall well-being.

**Note:** Public search did not surface a direct psychedelic therapy affiliation for Dr. Vanderploeg. She may be interested in psychedelic-adjacent modalities or exploring integration of psychedelic therapy given the broader naturopathic interest in this space. Confirm with Jason: is her interest in PPN Portal as a clinical tool, a research tool, or is she considering expanding into psychedelic-assisted therapy?

**Relationship:** [Confirm — Jason's colleague? Referral from another contact?]

**Proposed Structure:** Research Partner — Advisory Exchange (suggested, pending confirmation of practice direction)

**Demo Angle:** If she is exploring psychedelic-assisted therapy as a new modality, the Wellness Journey workflow is the right demo — show her how a structured, safe clinical documentation system makes expansion into this space professionally defensible. If she is purely interested from a research / data standpoint, mirror the Dr. Allen approach.

**Status:** Need confirmation on practice interest and relationship before outreach materials are drafted.

## CONTACT 4: Julian J. Varela, MA, LMFT, MS, CSCS
**Organization:** Private Practice  
**Location:** Ventura, CA 93001  
**Title:** Marriage & Family Therapist  
**Credentials:** MA, LMFT, MS, CSCS — licensed in CA, AZ, NV, OR  
**Background:** MFT with a strength & conditioning science degree — unusual combination suggesting an integrative, body-mind approach to therapy. Active clinical practice. Focus areas include stress, anxiety, ADHD, burnout, relationship struggles, life transitions.

**Relationship:** [Confirm — Jason's peer? Personal connection?]

**Proposed Structure:** Uncertain — depends on his interest level and whether he is actively exploring psychedelic-assisted therapy. Options:
- If exploring the modality: **Guild tier** or early Research Partner access
- If highly interested and operationally ready: **Founding Partner** conversation

**Demo Angle:** Practitioner-first. He sees clients regularly. Show him the Wellness Journey workflow as if *he* is the practitioner logging a session. Make it feel like his practice. The compliance and legal architecture story is secondary — what he needs to see is that documentation becomes *easier*, not more complex.

Key framing:
> *"Instead of writing session notes in a Google Doc that lives nowhere in particular, everything is structured, searchable, timestamped, and tied to a clinical record that follows the patient through the entire arc of care. It's the difference between a filing cabinet and a system."*

**Primary Demo Features:** Wellness Journey → Create new patient → Phase 1 forms → Phase 2 dosing documentation → Integration phase  
**Secondary:** Interaction Checker (he'll appreciate the clinical safety angle)

**Status:** Need confirmation on psychedelic therapy involvement before outreach materials are drafted.

## WHAT JASON NEEDS TO CONFIRM (SHORT LIST)

1. What is his relationship to each of Dr. Allen, Varela, and Vanderploeg?
2. For Varela and Vanderploeg: are they actively doing or exploring psychedelic-assisted therapy?
3. Should any of these conversations happen *before* or *after* the Singularism demo?
4. Is there a preference for handling all four in one coordinated outreach push, or sequentially?
