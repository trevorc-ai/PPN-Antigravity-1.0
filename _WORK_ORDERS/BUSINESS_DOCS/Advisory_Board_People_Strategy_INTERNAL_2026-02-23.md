# Advisory Board, People Strategy, INTERNAL NOTES
**For:** Your eyes only, not for distribution
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Companion to:** Advisory_Board_People_Strategy_2026-02-23.md (presentation version)

---

## Operational Dependencies

- **WO-208** owns the product side of this: governance UI at `/governance/vocabulary-requests`, voting workflow, `log_vocabulary_requests` table, quorum logic. That ticket is sitting in `01_TRIAGE` with `owner: LEAD` and has not been routed to DESIGNER or BUILDER yet. It should not be activated until we have at least one confirmed Clinical Vocabulary Advisor to sit in the seat, otherwise we are building a board room before inviting anyone.

- **WO-208 Phase 1 feature gate** requires the admin UI table and the practitioner "request a concept" link to exist before the board has anything to vote on. Target: build this when first clinic is live and logging sessions.

## Document Architecture Rule (applied from 2026-02-23)

All BUSINESS_DOCS going forward split into two files:
- `[Topic]_DATE.md` = presentation-ready, shareable
- `[Topic]_INTERNAL_DATE.md` = this file type, operational notes, work order refs, routing instructions

## Advisory Board Sequencing Notes

- Do not formally constitute the board before Singularism signs. The first signed partner gives the advisory board something real to govern.
- Dr. Allen demo should come before any formal advisory ask. Sequence: demo, then follow-up conversation about involvement.
- The legal/regulatory seat (#2) is the highest-value empty seat. Worth a dedicated search conversation. Think about: anyone in the RFRA legal space, healthcare compliance attorneys with alternative medicine background, or policy people from the Plant Medicine coalition.
- Julian Varela is Role A (vocabulary governance), not Role B (strategic). Do not offer him a Research Partner designation unless his practice substantially expands into psychedelic-assisted therapy.
