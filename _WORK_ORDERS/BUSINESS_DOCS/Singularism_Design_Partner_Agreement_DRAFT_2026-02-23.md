## DESIGN PARTNER AGREEMENT
**PPN Portal — Founding Clinical Partner Program**

*Effective Date:* [DATE]  
*Between:* PPN Portal ("Company") and Singularism ("Partner")

---

### 1. PURPOSE

The Company is developing PPN Portal, a clinical data infrastructure platform for entheogenic and psychedelic therapy practice. The Partner has agreed to participate as a Founding Clinical Partner ("Design Partner") to co-develop, test, and refine the platform prior to general market release. This Agreement governs the terms of that participation.

---

### 2. WHAT THE COMPANY PROVIDES

**2.1 Platform Access**  
Full access to PPN Portal, including all features available at the time of onboarding and all material updates released during the term.

**2.2 Direct Support**  
A dedicated point of contact on the Company team for questions, issues, and feedback. Response within one business day. Not routed through a general support queue.

**2.3 Roadmap Input**  
Two (2) structured feedback sessions during the term (Month 1 and Month 6), minimum 45 minutes each, in which Partner's operational needs are formally reviewed against the product roadmap. Partner's stated priorities will be documented and considered in build prioritization decisions. The Company makes no guarantee that specific features will be built, but commits to honest and responsive engagement.

**2.4 Founding Clinical Partner Designation**  
Partner is authorized to use the designation "Founding Clinical Partner — PPN Portal" in its own marketing, communications, and legal materials for the duration of this Agreement and in perpetuity thereafter, provided the platform relationship remains in good standing.

**2.5 Permanent Research Partner Pricing**  
After the expiration of this Agreement, Partner will convert to a Research Partner subscription tier at pricing no greater than $[X]/year, locked permanently regardless of future public pricing increases.

---

### 3. WHAT THE PARTNER PROVIDES

**3.1 Investment**  
Partner agrees to pay to the Company the sum of **$35,000 USD** (the "Design Partner Fee"), due as a single payment within ten (10) business days of execution of this Agreement, by wire transfer to account details to be provided separately.

*Alternative payment schedule (if raised by Partner):*  
$20,000 on execution + $15,000 due six (6) months from execution date.

**3.2 Structured Feedback**  
Partner agrees to participate in the two scheduled feedback sessions described in Section 2.3 and to provide reasonable written or verbal responses to the Company's periodic feedback requests (no more than two questions per month, delivered asynchronously).

**3.3 Reference Rights**  
Partner grants the Company the right to identify Singularism as a Founding Clinical Partner in the Company's marketing materials, investor communications, and public statements, subject to Partner's advance written approval of any specific language used (approval not to be unreasonably withheld, and deemed given if not responded to within five business days).

---

### 4. DATA AND PRIVACY

**4.1 No PHI in System Records**  
The Company's platform is architected to avoid storage of Protected Health Information. Participants are referenced in the system by anonymous Subject IDs only. Partner is responsible for maintaining the mapping between Subject IDs and real participant identities in Partner's own records, outside the platform.

**4.2 Partner Data Ownership**  
All clinical data entered into PPN Portal by Partner remains the property of Partner. The Company will not share, sell, or use Partner's data for any purpose other than platform operation and (in anonymized, de-identified aggregate form only) product improvement.

**4.3 Data Export**  
Partner may request a full export of their data at any time during the term. The Company will deliver the export within five business days of request, in a standard machine-readable format (CSV or JSON).

This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and runs for twelve (12) months.

**5.3 Termination Without Cause**  
Either party may terminate this Agreement with thirty (30) days written notice. In the event of termination by Company without cause prior to the end of the term, Company will refund Partner a prorated portion of the Design Partner Fee for the unused months. In the event of termination by Partner without cause, the Design Partner Fee is non-refundable.

## NEGOTIATION NOTES (Internal Only)
- Open: $35,000
- First concession (only if blocked): $28,000 + add one extra feedback session
- Walk-to: $25,000
- Hard floor: $22,000 — below this, the precedent damages every subsequent clinic conversation
- Do NOT volunteer split payment. If they ask, offer $20K on signing + $15K at 6 months.
- The compliance/legal framing is the strongest lever — their records were physically seized. Lead with that.
- Jason has the relationship. He should present the agreement, not email it cold.
