# Founding Clinical Partner, Onboarding Checklist
**Prepared by:** PPN Portal Team
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Applies to:** All Founding Clinical Partner accounts

The goal of the first 30 days is not feature adoption. It is relationship confidence, making the partner feel they made the right decision and that the team they chose is exceptional.

## Phase 3: Active Use

### Weekly Async Pulse (We Send)
Two questions maximum. Should take under 60 seconds to answer.

Early months:
- "Did you log any sessions this week? If yes, anything confusing?"
- "Is there anything you tried to do that you could not figure out?"
- "On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident do you feel using the platform right now?"

Later months:
- "What is the one thing that would make the platform more useful for your practice?"
- "Have you shown it to anyone else on your team? What did they say?"
- "Is there a documentation situation where the platform helped you feel more protected?"

### Month 1 Feedback Session (30 to 45 minutes)
Focus: Clinical workflow experience
- [ ] Walk through a real session they documented. What worked, what did not?
- [ ] Consent flow: does it feel natural? Anything missing?
- [ ] Phase 1 forms: are the fields relevant to what they actually track?
- [ ] Anything they wish they could show their participants?

### Month 3 Feedback Session (45 minutes)
Focus: Outcome data and strategic value
- [ ] Are they seeing PHQ-9 or outcome data accumulate?
- [ ] Is the benchmark intelligence concept landing for them?
- [ ] "If someone asked you to describe PPN Portal in two sentences, what would you say?"
- [ ] Soft ask: would they be willing to record a short informal testimonial?

---

## Phase 4: End of Term

### Transition Conversation (Month 11)
- [ ] Review the year. What changed in their practice?
- [ ] Confirm Research Partner rate going forward
- [ ] Case study conversation:
  - Would they be willing to be featured publicly?
  - What is the right framing given their situation?
  - We draft, they approve
- [ ] Referral ask: who else in their network should we be talking to?

### Formal Close
- [ ] Research Partner subscription activated at locked rate
- [ ] Founding Clinical Partner designation and approved language delivered for their use
- [ ] Account noted internally as a reference account

## Welcome Email (Day 0, after wire confirms)

Subject: Welcome to PPN Portal, you are in.

Hi [first name],

The agreement is signed and the platform is ready. Welcome to the founding cohort.

Here is what happens next:

You will receive your login credentials and a short video walking you through the platform at your own pace. We will also schedule a 60-minute kickoff call, no agenda beyond making sure you are comfortable and showing us where you would like to start.

We are genuinely glad you are first.

[Your name]

P.S. If anything looks wrong or confusing before the kickoff call, reach us directly. No ticket required.

## Health Check (Internal, Track Monthly)

| What We Watch | Target | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| Sessions logged per month | 2 or more by Month 2 | Zero after Month 1 means adoption risk |
| Kickoff call completed | Within first week | Not scheduled after 7 days, follow up immediately |
| Async pulse response rate | 70% or above | Below 50% means the relationship needs attention |
| Month 1 feedback call | Completed | If missed, reschedule within 5 days |
| Satisfaction check (1 to 5) | 4 or above by Month 3 | Below 3, have a direct conversation |
