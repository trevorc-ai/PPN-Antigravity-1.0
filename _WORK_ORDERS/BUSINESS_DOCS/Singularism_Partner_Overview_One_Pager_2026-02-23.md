# PPN Portal, Founding Partner Overview
**For:** Singularism
**Prepared by:** PPN Portal Team

## What We Built

PPN Portal is clinical data infrastructure for entheogenic and psychedelic therapy practice. It handles the documentation layer that no EHR was designed for, including consent workflows, session records, integration tracking, and outcome measurement, all built around a single non-negotiable architectural principle:

**No participant identity information is stored in the system.** Participants exist in the record as anonymous Subject IDs. The mapping to a real person lives in your records, under your control, outside our software. This is not a policy. It is a technical constraint built into the data model from day one.

Every clinical event is timestamped, immutable, and auditable. Consent is documented. Outcomes are tracked. The record is defensible.

## Founding Clinical Partner Program

We are opening access to a small cohort of founding partners before public launch. Three organizations. Singularism is one of the ones we want.

**What partners receive:**

- Full platform access from day one, including all updates during the term
- Direct line to our team, not a support queue
- Two structured sessions where your operational needs inform our roadmap directly
- **Founding Clinical Partner** designation, in perpetuity, yours to use in marketing, communications, and legal materials
- **Permanent Research Partner pricing**, locked before public launch, regardless of future price increases

**The investment:** $35,000 for 12 months, single payment.

After the founding period, partners convert to the Research Partner tier permanently, the lowest pricing tier we will ever offer, available only to organizations who joined before public launch.

## Why the Data Architecture Matters

Most clinical software is built for efficiency. Ours is built for defensibility.

The difference: efficient systems let practitioners type whatever they want into fields. Our system uses controlled vocabulary exclusively. Practitioners select from validated options. There is no free-text field in any clinical form. That means there is no mechanism by which a participant's name, identifying information, or personal details can enter the database, even accidentally.

Combined with anonymous Subject IDs and an immutable audit trail, the system produces a record of care that is:

- Legally defensible in a regulatory or legal proceeding
- Analytically useful for outcomes research
- Architecturally incapable of creating PHI exposure
