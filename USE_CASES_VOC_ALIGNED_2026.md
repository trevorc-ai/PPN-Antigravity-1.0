## ✅ CONFIRMED USE CASES (Existing + VoC Validated)

### **Use Case 1: "Prove You're Not Reckless"**
**VoC Alignment:** ✅ **STRONG** - Maps to "Safety, screening, and harm reduction standards"

**Practitioner Quote (VoC):**
> "We need a way to operate that does not put our whole community at risk. We need documentation that protects us, not documentation that creates more exposure."

**Problem (VoC Language):**
- Law enforcement intrusion risk (seizure of substances, written records)
- Legitimacy and trust gap (public skepticism about "unlicensed therapy")
- Need for "safe and effective" framed pathway

**Solution (Current):**
- SafetyRiskMatrix: Proactive risk assessment
- SafetySurveillance: Real-time adverse event monitoring
- SafetyBenchmark: Performance vs. network standards

**VoC-Driven Enhancements Needed:**

---

### **Use Case 2: "Reduce Malpractice Exposure"**
**VoC Alignment:** ✅ **STRONG** - Maps to "Liability and ethical minefield"

**Practitioner Quote (VoC):**
> "What is my malpractice exposure if something goes wrong? What documentation protects me, and what documentation creates risk?"

**Problem (VoC Language):**
- Anxiety regarding legal and ethical exposure (VoC: "background radiation of the industry")

> "State requires adverse event reporting, session logs, and safety documentation. How do I stay compliant without drowning in paperwork?"

**Problem (VoC Language):**
- Regulatory uncertainty (VoC: "regulatory void")
- State-by-state variation (VoC: "regulations changing monthly")
- Operational burden (VoC: "high operating costs")

## 🟡 PARTIALLY ALIGNED USE CASES (Needs Refinement)

### **Use Case 4: "Get Reimbursement Approved"**
**VoC Alignment:** 🟡 **MODERATE** - Maps to "Reimbursement and operating reality"

**Practitioner Quote (VoC):**
> "Coverage remains limited and inconsistent, which creates operational constraints and pushes clinics into cash-pay models with pricing pressure."

**Current Problem Statement:**
> "Payers keep denying claims. How do I prove this treatment works and is medically necessary?"

**VoC Reality Check:**
- ❌ **Current framing is too optimistic** - VoC shows reimbursement is "limited and inconsistent"
- ✅ **Outcomes data is correct** - VoC confirms "credible, shareable quantitative data" is needed
- ⚠️ **Missing CPT code confusion** - VoC shows "immense confusion around CPT codes"

**Refined Problem Statement (VoC-Aligned):**
> "Reimbursement is inconsistent and confusing. How do I navigate CPT codes, build payer credibility, and prove medical necessity when coverage is limited?"

**VoC-Driven Enhancements Needed:**
- ✅ Add: CPT code guidance (0820T, 90837) (VoC: "billing cheat sheets")
- ✅ Add: Prior authorization templates (VoC: "automated reports for prior auth")
- ✅ Add: Real-world evidence package (VoC: "payers demand RWE")

---

### **Use Case 5: "Scale Without Quality Collapse"**
**VoC Alignment:** 🟡 **MODERATE** - Maps to "Operational reality" and "Group models"

**Current Problem Statement:**
> "We're opening new sites. How do we ensure consistent quality and safety across locations?"

**VoC Reality Check:**
- ✅ **Standardization is correct** - VoC confirms "standardized protocol reporting" is top need
- ⚠️ **Missing group therapy context** - VoC shows shift toward "group therapy and community models"
- ⚠️ **Missing training/supervision** - VoC shows "supervision desert" is major pain point

**VoC-Driven Enhancements Needed:**
- ✅ Add: Group therapy cohort management (VoC: "scheduling for groups")
- ✅ Add: Practitioner training workflows (VoC: "new sites learn from top performers")
- ✅ Add: Peer supervision matching (VoC: "supervision exchange")

## 🔴 MISSING USE CASES (High VoC Demand)

### **Use Case 6: "Solve the Software/Workflow Failure"** ⭐ NEW
**VoC Alignment:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - VoC Priority #1 Pain Point

**Practitioner Quote (VoC):**
> "A typical practitioner describes a workflow that is a patchwork of disconnected tools: IntakeQ for forms, Spruce for secure messaging, Spotify for music, Excel for tracking outcomes, and a generic EHR like SimplePractice for billing. This fragmentation leads to 'administrative burnout' and data silos."

**Problem:**
- Standard EHRs fail for 6-8 hour sessions (VoC: "wholly unsuited for PAT")
- Fragmented tool stack (4-5 disparate tools)
- Manual data entry burden (VoC: "measurement-based care void")

**Solution (NEW - Must Build):**
- **Digital Clinical Container:**
  - Session logger for 6-8 hour sessions (tap-to-log events)
  - Automated MBC (MEQ-30, Watts Connectedness Scale)
  - Protocol wiki (community-maintained, expert-vetted)

**ROI:**
- **Time saved:** 5-10 hours/week on documentation
- **Data quality:** Automated outcomes tracking
- **Reduced burnout:** Single integrated platform

**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - This is the #1 VoC pain point

---

### **Use Case 7: "Find Peer Supervision & Mentorship"** ⭐ NEW
**VoC Alignment:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - VoC Priority #2 Pain Point

**Practitioner Quote (VoC):**
> "The transition from 'trainee' to 'practitioner' is described as a perilous cliff. Once in practice, clinicians feel isolated. The unique challenges of PAT—such as intense counter-transference, spiritual emergencies, or erotic transference in altered states—require specialized supervision that is hard to find."

**Problem:**
- Post-training "cliff" (VoC: "expensive certification programs lack experiential component")
- Isolation in practice (VoC: "lone wolf burnout")
- Need for specialized supervision (VoC: "complex transference, adverse events")

**Solution (NEW - Must Build):**
- **Supervision Exchange:**
  - Dyad matching (complementary skills)
  - Circle system (6-8 practitioner cohorts)
  - Verified "Elder" directory (20+ years experience)

**ROI:**
- **Reduced isolation:** Peer support network
- **Better outcomes:** Learn from experienced practitioners
- **Career development:** Mentorship pathways

**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - This is the #2 VoC pain point

---

### **Use Case 8: "Standardize Integration Protocols"** ⭐ NEW
**VoC Alignment:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - VoC Priority #3 Pain Point

**Practitioner Quote (VoC):**
> "Integration is the most common 'bridge concept' between practitioner intent and client outcomes. It is described as necessary, but also expensive and time-consuming. There is a lack of structured tools to keep clients engaged between sessions."

**Problem:**
- Integration is "necessary but expensive" (VoC: "hours, collides with outpatient economics")
- Unclear definition (VoC: "what integration actually means in practice")
- High client churn (VoC: "patients drop off without psychological scaffolding")

**Solution (NEW - Must Build):**
- **Integration Hub:**
  - Structured integration protocols (before/during/after)
  - Homework assignment tools (VoC: "assign homework")
  - Neuroplasticity window tracking (VoC: "track neuroplasticity windows")
  - Integration measurement (IES/EIS)

**ROI:**
- **Reduced churn:** Better client retention
- **Better outcomes:** Sustained remission (not just temporary relief)
- **Revenue stability:** Predictable integration revenue stream

**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - This is the #3 VoC pain point
