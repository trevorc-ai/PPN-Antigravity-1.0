## 🎯 WHAT MARKETER NEEDS TO DO

### **Phase 1 Deliverables (Current)**

For **each of the 4 work orders**, MARKETER must create:

1. **Value Proposition Document**
   - Target audience
   - Pain point
   - Solution
   - Key metric

2. **Messaging Framework**
   - Hero headline
   - Supporting copy
   - Call-to-action
   - Objection handling

3. **Legal Disclaimers**
   - Reviewed language
   - Risk mitigation
   - Positioning (safety tool, not medical device)

4. **Conversion Strategy**
   - Onboarding flow
   - Activation triggers
   - Retention hooks

### **Timeline**
- **Per work order:** 1-2 days
- **Total (all 4):** 4-8 days
