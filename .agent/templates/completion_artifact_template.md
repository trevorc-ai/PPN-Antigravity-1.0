## 🔁 NEXT ACTIONS (MANDATORY — Do not leave blank)

> Every agent MUST complete this section before moving the ticket to 04_QA.
> Leaving this blank is a protocol violation. The pipeline must never stall.

**Immediate follow-on tickets to create (if any):**
- [ ] WO-[ID]: [Brief description] → assign to [AGENT]
- [ ] WO-[ID]: [Brief description] → assign to [AGENT]

**Tickets this work unblocks:**
- [ ] WO-[ID]: [Ticket name] — now unblocked, move to [AGENT]'s queue

**Queue scan — agent's next ticket:**
- After moving this ticket to `04_QA/`, immediately scan `_WORK_ORDERS/03_BUILD/` for the next ticket with `owner: [YOUR AGENT NAME]` and begin work without waiting for instruction.

**If no follow-on tickets exist:**
- State explicitly: "No follow-on tickets required. Queue scan complete. [Next ticket / No tickets remaining]."
