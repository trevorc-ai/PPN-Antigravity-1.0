## 🎯 Core Market Reality

### **What Practitioners Actually Need**

Based on comprehensive VoC analysis (2020-2026), practitioners are NOT asking for:
- ❌ More "psychedelic renaissance" hype
- ❌ General education content
- ❌ Another social network

They ARE desperately asking for:
- ✅ **Operational scaffolding** - "How do I run this safely and legally?"
- ✅ **Liability protection** - Defensible documentation, consent templates, insurance
- ✅ **Workflow efficiency** - Tools that reduce admin burden, not increase it
- ✅ **Peer benchmarking** - "Am I doing this right compared to peers?"
- ✅ **Real-world evidence** - Quantifiable outcomes to prove efficacy

## 🔥 Top Pain Points (Ranked by Urgency)

### **1. Software/Workflow Failure** (CRITICAL)
**The Problem:**
- Generic EHRs built for "15-minute med checks" fail for 6-8 hour psychedelic sessions
- Practitioners patch together 4-5 disconnected tools (IntakeQ, Spruce, Excel, SimplePractice)
- Osmind (specialized solution) described as "clunky," "unintuitive," billing issues

**User Quote:**
> "Administrative burnout from fragmented tools is killing us"

**Implication for PPN:**
- Protocol Builder MUST be fast (<2 min data entry)
- Must integrate seamlessly or replace fragmented workflow
- Auto-generate narrative charts from structured inputs

---

### **2. Liability & Ethics Minefield** (CRITICAL)
**The Problem:**
- No standardized "informed consent" for touch, ontological shock
- Liability insurance either unavailable or prohibitively expensive
- Fear of malpractice suits paralyzes practice

**User Quote:**
> "If outcomes are inconsistent, I will be blamed, audited, or sued"

**Implication for PPN:**
- Consent templates MUST be legally robust, jurisdiction-specific
- Documentation must be "audit-ready" from day one
- Safety event logging must be comprehensive

---

### **3. Supervision & Mentorship Vacuum** (HIGH)
**The Problem:**
- Expensive training programs lack experiential component
- Post-certification "cliff" - practitioners feel abandoned
- No centralized marketplace for peer supervision

**User Quote:**
> "I feel isolated. The unique challenges of PAT require specialized supervision that's hard to find"

**Implication for PPN:**
- Community features must enable peer supervision
- Mentorship matching could be valuable add-on
- Case consultation forums (private, verified)

---

### **4. Integration & Retention Gap** (HIGH)
**The Problem:**
- Clinics focused on "drug delivery" face high churn
- No structured tools to keep clients engaged between sessions
- "Ketamine works really well... but the ketamine industry doesn't"

**Implication for PPN:**
- Integration tracking tools essential
- Homework assignment features
- Neuroplasticity window tracking

---

## 📊 Market Sizing Reality Check

### **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
- **3,500 unique US "interventional mood treatment sites"** (conservative)
- **TAM ARR:** ~$25.2M (at $600/site/month)
- **Reality:** This is NOT a "billion-dollar SaaS TAM"

### **SAM (Serviceable Available Market - 24 months)**
- **400-800 sites** realistically serviceable

### **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market - 24 months)**
- **50-150 paying sites** (realistic goal)
- **5-20 multi-site operators** as anchor customers

---

## 🎯 Product Positioning

### **What PPN IS:**
> "The Operating System for Psychedelic Practice"
> "Audit-ready, benchmarkable operations in a field where practice varies widely and liability anxiety is high"

### **What PPN IS NOT:**
- Not an EHR replacement
- Not a practice management system
- Not a patient portal
- Not a document storage system

### **Blue Ocean Strategy:**
The intersection of:
- Psychedelic treatment-specific exposure structure
- Cross-site peer benchmarking
- Safety signal reporting
- No-PHI data posture
- "Quality improvement" framing

---

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### **North Star Metric:**
**Benchmark-ready episodes per month**

Definition: An episode is benchmark-ready when it has:
1. Baseline outcome measure
2. At least one defined follow-up timepoint
3. Coded exposure record (substance, route, dose unit)
4. Coded setting and support structure
5. Coded safety event capture

### **Adoption Requirements:**
Platform MUST deliver visible operational value in **first 2 weeks**, not 6 months.

**Week 1 Value:**
- Site-only delta charts
- Completeness heatmaps
- Immediate feedback on data quality

**Week 2-4 Value:**
- First benchmark comparisons (if network has data)
- Exportable reports for insurance/compliance
- Time savings vs. manual tracking

---

## 💰 Pricing Strategy

### **Market Anchors:**
- Osmind EHR: $249/clinician/month
- This defines what interventional psychiatry clinics tolerate

### **Recommended Tiers:**

| Tier | Target | Price | Features |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| **Free (Reader)** | Evaluators | $0 | Read-only demo dashboards |
| **Clinic Basic** | Single-site | $399/site/month | Site-only dashboards, outcomes capture |
| **Clinic Benchmark** | Give-to-get | $699/site/month | Network benchmarks, safety dashboards |

## 🎨 UX Design Imperatives

### **From Market Research:**

1. **Speed is Non-Negotiable**
   - Target: <2 minutes for complete protocol entry
   - User quote: "Expensive and time consuming" is the #1 barrier

2. **Reduce Cognitive Load**
   - Button groups > Dropdowns (for small option sets)
   - Auto-complete > Manual entry
   - Smart defaults > Blank forms

3. **Visual Feedback is Critical**
   - Progress indicators
   - Completeness scores
   - Real-time validation

4. **Mobile-Friendly for Session Logging**
   - Tablet-friendly interface for 6-hour sessions
   - Tap-to-log events (e.g., "14:00 - Distress," "14:15 - Booster")
   - Auto-generate narrative charts

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Compliance Non-Negotiables

### **From Research:**

1. **No PHI, Ever**
   - No names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, DOB, MRNs
   - Hashed subject identifiers only
   - No free-text clinical narratives

2. **HIPAA Safe Harbor Compliance**
   - Dates: Year only (not month/day)
   - Ages: Group ages >89
   - Small-cell suppression: N ≥ 10 minimum

3. **Transparency as Product Feature**
   - "What we do NOT collect" as first-class product page
   - Linked everywhere
   - Build trust through radical transparency

---

## 🚀 Go-to-Market Strategy

### **First 1,000 Users = 50-150 Sites**
(Not individual practitioners - SITES are the unit)

### **Organic Acquisition Channels:**

1. **Training Cohorts**
   - Colorado DORA-approved training programs
   - Oregon psilocybin facilitator programs
   - Position as "evidence and quality infrastructure"

2. **Content Marketing (Practitioner Intent)**
   - "How to structure outcomes tracking for ketamine care"
   - "Safety signal dashboards and adverse event coding"
   - "Benchmark methodology and suppression rules"

3. **Professional Organizations**
   - ASKP (American Society of Ketamine Physicians)
   - BrainFutures
   - American Psychedelic Practitioners Association

### **Virality Mechanism: "Give-to-Get"**
- No contribution = No network benchmarks
- Benchmark badges for clinic marketing
- Training cohorts as referral engines

## ⚠️ Pre-Mortem: Top 3 Failure Modes

### **Failure #1: Network Never Hits "Benchmark Density"**
**Prevention:**
- Enforce contribution requirements for benchmark access
- Show "benchmark readiness" progress weekly
- Provide immediate value in week one

### **Failure #2: Privacy Incident or Credibility Breach**
**Prevention:**
- No free-text answers in patient-referenced logs
- Suppression in SQL layer, not UI
- Safe Harbor constraints strictly enforced

### **Failure #3: Workflow Incumbents Bundle Outcomes**
**Prevention:**
- Position as neutral benchmarking network
- Psychedelic-specific exposure modeling
- Start as "thin layer" with no EHR dependency

---

## 📋 Decision Framework for Product Features

### **Before Building ANY Feature, Ask:**

1. **Does this reduce data entry time?**
   - If no, reconsider

2. **Does this reduce liability anxiety?**
   - Consent templates, audit trails, safety logging

3. **Does this enable peer benchmarking?**
   - Structured data, coded values, comparable metrics

4. **Does this work without PHI?**
   - If it requires PHI, redesign

5. **Does this deliver value in Week 1?**
   - If value comes in Month 6, it's too late
