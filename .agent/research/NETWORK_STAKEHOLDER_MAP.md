## The Warm Network (Full)

### 1. Jason Bluth
**Role:** Co-founder and field activator
**Contact:** jbluths@gmail.com
**Segment:** Network connector / distribution engine
**Background:** Grew up Mormon, did a mission in Arizona. Now in Utah, connected to the Singularism/psilocybin church community. Has run high-level demos with Bridger, Julian, and Sarah. Actively pitching the hub-and-spoke model.

**Status:** Partner. Sees product Feb 20, 2026. Has run demos independently.
**Key strengths:** Trust with practitioners and church communities. Bilingual (Spanish). Relationship capital.

**What he needs:**
- Working demo script (DONE — see jason-demo.html)
- Updated platform link to show practitioners
- Clear narrative for each audience type

**Waiting on him to:**
- Connect Dr. Russell Hill and Julian Bareilles to network call
- Follow up with Singularism/Bridger on beta timeline
- Explore insurance company angle (family contact)
- Get Dr. Allen deep-dive meeting scheduled (Seattle or Zoom)

---

### 2. Dr. Jason Allen
**Role:** Medical legitimacy anchor and advisory council lead
**Segment:** Clinical Convert / Scientific
**Background:** NIH-funded doctor and naturopath. 20 years in the field. Network "guru." Appreciated the affinity binding feature and the pharma-ready data standards. Personally endorsed by Jason as the practitioner who validates PPN's scientific credibility.

**Status:** Enthusiastic. Deep-dive session requested but not yet scheduled.

**Specific needs from the platform:**
- Ability to see which metrics clinical community should standardize on (PHQ9, GAD, mystical score)
- Input on which 4+ databases the system should pull from
- Validation of the biopsychosocial questionnaire structure

**His primary question:** "Is this rigorous enough to stake my reputation on?"
**Key hook:** "We're building the real-world evidence dataset that clinical trials can't ethically generate."

**Next step:** Jason schedules a multi-hour Zoom deep-dive with Trevor. Trevor records and transcribes.

---

### 3. John Turner
**Role:** Strategic advisor and potential investor
**Segment:** Legal / Investment
**Background:** Retired venture capital attorney. Late 60s. Avid psychedelic enthusiast. Knows Sarah Honeyut (they share a mutual connection). Interest in fundraising for the project mentioned.

**Status:** Warm. Needs a formal first proper presentation.

**His primary question:** "Is this defensible? What's the moat? What's the exit?"
**Key hook:** "First mover in an infrastructure play for a $10B+ market. Zero-PHI is a structural moat competitors can't replicate."

**Next step:** Send partner-preview.html. Request 30-minute call. Trevor prepares a one-page investor brief.

---

### 4. Bridger Lee Jensen
**Role:** Psilocybin church / ceremonial segment anchor
**Organization:** Singularism (largest psilocybin church in the US, Utah/California)
**Segment:** Religious / Ceremonial / RFRA
**Background:** Runs church using RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) protections. Facilitated sessions where members consume psilocybin tea, with scribes documenting. Lawsuit with federal government ongoing. Judges have called the church "legit." Settlement or trial scheduled for next year.

Jason's connection: Shared interest in motorcycles. Jason offered track riding coaching. Strong personal rapport established.

**Status:** URGENT. After Jason's demo, Bridger asked "Is it ready? Can we be beta testers?" Described as "like a kid wanting cake." Offered to extend the church's legal umbrella to cover PPN and individual practitioners for federal liability exposure. This is an extraordinary offer that has not been formally accepted.

**His primary question:** "Does this protect my congregation or give the government a roadmap to them?"
**Key hook:** "Documented standard of care shifts the terrain from 'drug distribution' to 'religious program administration.' Phantom Shield is the tool."

**Distribution opportunity:** Church has existing membership of facilitators. Bridger reportedly trains practitioners and members. PPN could be bundled into the church's onboarding as a documentation standard for ALL facilitators.

**Legal note:** His legal context is RFRA religious exemption, not grey market. His members are not hiding — they're publicly fighting. Documentation strengthens his legal position.

**Next step:** Jason or Trevor contacts Bridger this week with Phantom Shield overview. Ask: "Are you ready for beta? When?" Do NOT wait.

### 5. Dr. Sheena Vander-Ploeg
**Role:** Naturopathic practitioner and international operator
**Segment:** Naturopathic / Integrative / International
**Background:** Naturopathic doctor. Business owner. High energy. International travel. Connected to Trevor and Jason's network.

**Status:** Awaiting formal demo.

**Her primary question:** "Does this fit my practice, my clients, and my international workflow?"
**Key hook:** "Zero-PHI travels across jurisdictions. No US-specific legal lock-in."

**Next step:** Send ppnportal.net landing page. Schedule live demo of protocol builder.

---

### 6. Dr. Russell Hill
**Role:** Clinic operator (first contact)
**Segment:** Clinic Owner / ER to Psychedelic
**Background:** ER doctor in Hawaii. Currently purchasing a ketamine clinic. No direct psychedelic experience yet but seeking guidance on treatments. Jason connected him to Dr. Allen for clinical advice. Described as lost despite attending conferences.

**Status:** Intro stage. Jason is connecting him to the network.

**His primary question:** "What do I need to know about drug interactions and protocols to run this clinic safely?"
**Key hook:** The interaction checker and clinical protocol database. He needs the safety infrastructure before he needs the benchmarking.

**Next step:** Jason facilitates intro call with Dr. Allen. PPN should be introduced as the tool all three will use together.

### 7. Julian Bareilles
**Role:** Multi-state practitioner and standardization champion
**Segment:** Licensed MFT / Multi-jurisdictional
**Background:** Marriage and family therapist licensed in 4 states. Enthusiastic about real-time data access and the "synthesis of efficacy improvements" (e.g., 5 points better on PHQ score). Agreed to help with standardization. Interested in harm reduction.

**Status:** Engaged. Has seen a demo. Wants to participate in defining the output standards.

**His specific feedback:**
- PHQ9 improvement examples resonated strongly
- Excited about practitioner knowledge elevation
- Asked about QEEG brain scanning integration
- Wants harm reduction language emphasized

**Next step:** Include Julian in the Dr. Allen deep-dive session.

### 8. Sarah Honeyut
**Role:** Frontline practitioner and product advisor
**Segment:** Oregon Facilitator / Althia Migration Target
**Background:** Psychedelic practitioner in Oregon. Currently using Althia (finds it non-user-friendly). Mutual connection with John Turner. Participated in the Feb 10 demo. Her feedback is the most detailed product input received to date.

**Status:** Wants to be an advisor. Will connect the team to the Sheri Eert Foundation and other researchers.

**Her product feedback (implement this):**
- Molecular source/producer tracking (batch quality tracking)
- Mystical experience score for clients
- Oregon dosing standard: 50mg psilocybin max, up to 15g dried mushrooms
- Potency tracking per mushroom strain/batch
- Practitioner demographics tied to outcomes
- Herbal supplement interactions (St. John's Wort = natural MAOI, often unreported)
- Simple "client tracker" view vs. full clinical view
- Remove regulatory map from main interface (move to newsletter)
- Cultural/genetic differences in psychedelic response (Asian populations especially)
- Post-journey follow-up tracking (outcome measured at 2 weeks, not just session day)
- Scholarship fund participants as data contributors (low-income, addiction focus)

**Next step:** Send formal advisor request. Integrate her feedback into product backlog.

## Additional Contacts from Meeting Notes

- **Dr. Vega:** Ibogaine researcher. Scientist tier contact. Mentioned alongside Dr. Allen as the type of expert whose protocols need to be in the system for credibility with states.
- **Brian:** Running for House Representative, District 29. Political contact. Trevor may be involved in strategy and consulting for the campaign.
- **Brandy:** Bridger's partner. Was also excited about PPN during the psilocybin church demo.
