# PPN Research Portal — Audience-Specific PDF Briefs
## For DESIGNER Review | February 2026
**Prepared by:** PRODDY  
**Purpose:** Define 4 distinct PDF variants drawn from the master User Manual. Each is a remixed, reprioritized, and reframed version of the same underlying content — optimized for a specific reader's anxieties, goals, and vocabulary.

> **Design Note:** All 4 PDFs should share the same brand identity (colors, typography, logo) but differ in cover design, section order, tone, and content emphasis. DESIGNER should treat each as a standalone document, not a template with swapped covers.

## The 4 Audiences & Their Primary Anxiety

| # | Audience | Primary Anxiety | Primary Goal |
|---|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Business Partners / Investors** | "Is this investable / partnable?" | Validate the business and product |
| 2 | **Licensed Clinicians (Clinical Converts)** | "Will this create liability for me?" | Reduce risk, protect their license |
| 3 | **Clinic Operators** | "Will this save me money and time?" | ROI, efficiency, operational wins |
| 4 | **Independent / Integration Practitioners** | "Will this expose me?" | Privacy, safety, discretion |

> **Sensitive note for DESIGNER and MARKETER:** This audience is privacy-conscious and skeptical of institutional tools. The cover should not use clinical/medical language. Lead with safety and discretion. Do NOT use the word "patient" — use "client" or "participant."

- Zero-PHI is not a feature — it's the foundation
- "We built this so that documenting your work never creates legal exposure"
- What the tool is: a structured outcomes registry. What it is NOT: a reporting system to any authority.

- "What we never collect" list (PHI list) — make this visually prominent
- Subject IDs: how they work (you create them, we never see who they map to)
- Session dates: stored as year only

- The practical case: "One bad incident can end your practice. Documented standard processes protect you."
- RFRA petition framing: for religious practitioners, governance records are legally protective

**4. The Documentation Workflow (Without the Overhead)** *(2 pages)*
