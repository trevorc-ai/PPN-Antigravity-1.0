The resurgence of psychedelic medicine represents a profound paradigm shift in psychiatry, necessitating a sophisticated data infrastructure to capture the multifaceted nature of these interventions. Unlike traditional pharmacotherapies, psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) combines pharmacological triggers with intensive psychological support, creating a complex interaction that challenges standard clinical trial designs and data collection methodologies. This analysis provides an exhaustive examination of the current psychedelic data ecosystem, ranging from molecular-level informatics to large-scale real-world evidence and collective intelligence frameworks.
Data Infrastructure and Clinical Trial Registries
The foundational layer of psychedelic research is composed of established clinical registries and peer-reviewed literature databases. Systematic reviews in this domain frequently utilize the 2020 PRISMA guidelines to navigate the vast volume of manuscripts identified across PubMed, EBSCO, and EMBASE.1 For instance, a comprehensive review of psychedelics for psychiatric conditions identified over 4,376 manuscripts, of which only a small fraction met the rigorous eligibility criteria for safety and efficacy analysis.1 This discrepancy underscores the necessity for centralized registries to manage the burgeoning interest in substances like psilocybin, MDMA, and LSD.
Trends in Clinical Registration and Market Growth
The volume of clinical research is expanding rapidly, with statistical analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov indicating a significant uptrend in registered trials.2 Between 2007 and 2020, 105 clinical trials met study inclusion criteria, with 77.1% of these starting in 2017 or later.2 This surge mirrors a broader increase in total registered clinical trials globally, reflecting the "renaissance" phase of the field.2
This research activity is closely tied to the projected economic trajectory of the psychedelic drugs market. Financial projections suggest the market size will reach approximately $10.75 billion by 2027, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 12.36% from 2021 to 2027.3 Such growth is fueled by regulatory milestones, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granting "breakthrough therapy" designation to psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).4

Current research gaps remain prominent, particularly in the use of psychedelics for symptomatic treatment during opioid tapering and for depression refractory to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).2 Furthermore, the lack of representation for older adults in trials is a significant limitation; in a sample of 1,400 patients across 36 studies, less than 1.4% were aged 65 or older.1 Preliminary safety data in this small cohort suggests that PAT is well-tolerated in older adults, with only transient mild-to-moderate adverse events reported, yet more rigorous investigation is required to generalize these findings.1
Publicly Available Datasets and Repositories
For researchers and practitioners, access to high-quality datasets is essential for independent analysis and the development of evidence-based protocols. Publicly accessible repositories range from large-scale national surveys to specialized psychedelic monitoring projects.
National Surveys and Longitudinal Platforms
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) maintains the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which provides critical data on substance use and mental health trends among the civilian noninstitutionalized population aged 12 and older.6 NSDUH public-use files (PUFs) are a primary resource for understanding the macro-level prevalence of psychedelic use and its correlation with mental illness and treatment-seeking behavior.6 To protect participant confidentiality, these files utilize disclosure-avoidance methods, meaning that while they generate comparable estimates to published reports, they are not identical.6
Complementing these national surveys are longitudinal platforms designed to improve the visibility of existing research. The King’s College London Atlas of Longitudinal Datasets provides a free platform for discovering over 1,600 longitudinal mental health datasets.7 This atlas allows researchers and policymakers to visualize data sources on a map, compare datasets, and identify research gaps, thereby promoting collaboration and reducing duplication.7

Specialized Psychedelic Tracking Systems
The National Survey of Psychedelic Use in the United States (NSIHT) represents the largest ongoing survey of adults using psychedelics in the U.S..10 The 2024 NSIHT findings revealed that psilocybin is the most frequently used psychedelic, with use being highest among younger adults and often occurring in small private settings with friends or family.10 Most participants perceived psychedelics as beneficial for their mental health, though use varied significantly by geographic region.10
In the academic and metadata space, the Blossom Analysis 'Originals' database catalogues controlled human trials for MDMA, psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, and DMT.12 This repository is unique because it provides meta-data such as dosing frequency, the type of placebo used, and the number of preparatory and integration sessions provided in each trial.12 This level of detail is crucial for researchers attempting to benchmark the intensity of psychological support across different therapeutic models.12
Subjective Experiences versus Biomarkers: Determining Data Value
A central debate in the psychedelic field concerns which data points provide the most therapeutic insight. While conventional medicine prioritizes objective biomarkers, the "psychedelic renaissance" has elevated the importance of acute subjective effects as predictors of long-term outcomes.
The Predictive Power of the "Trip"
Current evidence suggests that the acute subjective effects experienced during a psychedelic session—such as mystical-type experiences, ego dissolution, or "oneness"—are the best predictors of therapeutic durability.13 Researchers are developing tools to capture these phenomena, such as a new phenomenology scale for 5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and measures for "fresh experiences," characterized by a child-like state of perceiving familiar thoughts with "fresh eyes".13
However, the field is also exploring pre-session markers that can predict clinical response. Linguistic features analyzed from pre-session interviews have emerged as novel predictive markers of how a patient might respond to treatment.14 This suggests that the "set" (the internal state of the patient) is as measurable and valuable as the experience itself.
Neurobiological Mechanisms and Imaging Data
Objective neuroimaging data provides a mechanistic counterpart to subjective reports. Imaging studies consistently find that psychedelics massively disrupt functional connectivity (FC) in the brain.15 Psilocybin, for instance, reduces connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), which is thought to mediate the sense of space, time, and self.15 This desynchronization is believed to create a "fertile yet vulnerable window for change," allowing for the emergence of more dynamic and complex patterns of neural activity.16

The persistent reduction of hippocampal-DMN connectivity, which can last for weeks after a high-dose psilocybin session, may represent a neuroanatomical correlate of the sustained therapeutic effects observed in clinical trials.15 Theories such as "criticality" suggest that psychedelics move the brain towards a point between order and disorder, increasing algorithmic complexity and Shannon entropy.17
Real-World Evidence and the Patient Journey
The transition from the "ivory tower" of controlled clinical trials to real-world implementation is the next frontier for psychedelic medicine. Real-World Evidence (RWE) provides insights into the "patient journey," mapping the trajectory from initial preparation through the dosing experience to long-term integration.
The Phases of Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy
PAT is defined by a structured patient journey that typically involves three distinct phases:
	•	Preparation (2-10 hours): Patients are introduced to the treatment model, set intentions, and learn coping techniques such as mindfulness.20 This phase is critical for building a "supportive set" and is now being standardized through tools like the Psychedelic Preparedness Scale (PPS).14
	•	Dosing Session (1-8 hours): The acute experience occurs under the supervision of one or more qualified professionals. The duration depends on the substance: ketamine sessions are relatively short (under an hour), whereas psilocybin or LSD sessions can last up to eight hours.20
	•	Integration (Days to Months): Patients process and apply the insights gained. Structured integration typically involves two to three sessions of two to three hours each, though some case reports suggest that benefits are enhanced when integration continues for months.20
Efficacy in Naturalistic Settings
Real-world analyses, such as those conducted on at-home sublingual ketamine therapy facilitated by telehealth platforms (e.g., Mindbloom), show promising response rates. A large-scale analysis of 1,247 adults with moderate-to-severe depression and anxiety reported response rates between 56.4% and 62.8%.21 However, these real-world studies are often plagued by high attrition rates; the Hull et al. (2022) study suffered from over 55% missing follow-up data, which introduces a "serious risk of bias".21
In patient populations with life-threatening illness, RWE suggests that psilocybin treatment is associated with rapid and sustained reductions in suicidal ideation and loss of meaning, with effects lasting up to 4.5 years.22 These outcomes often exceed what is achievable with traditional antidepressants, which typically have a delayed onset of action and significant side effects such as emotional blunting.22
Failure Data: Identifying "What Went Wrong"
Analyzing failures and adverse events is critical for the safety and regulatory acceptance of psychedelic treatments. This involves examining serious adverse events (SAEs) in trials and identifying systemic reporting failures that hinder reproducibility.
Analysis of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
Systematic reviews of over 3,504 participants across 214 studies indicate that while classic psychedelics are generally well-tolerated in monitored settings, SAEs do occur, particularly in participants with preexisting neuropsychiatric disorders.25 Approximately 4% of participants with disorders experienced SAEs, which included worsening depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, and convulsive episodes.25

Adverse Event Type
Nature of Event
Historical vs. Contemporary Context
SAE
Psychosis requiring ECT
Reported in historical inpatient studies (1951-1972).25
SAE
Suicidal behavior / hospitalization
Rare in contemporary research; limited to those with MDD.25
SAE
Seizures
Occurred in participants with preexisting epilepsy or delirium tremens.25
NSAE
Headache, Nausea, Anxiety
Most common; transient and self-resolving.25
Importantly, contemporary research settings have reported no deaths by suicide, persistent psychotic disorders, or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) following high-dose classic psychedelic administration.25 However, the quality of AE reporting is often low; only 23.5% of studies since 2005 used a systematic approach to assessing AEs, and only 29.4% reported all AEs rather than just those deemed "drug-related".25
Systemic Failures in Trial Design and Reporting
A major "failure" in the field is the underreporting of the psychosocial intervention (PI). A systematic review of 33 published trials found that 82% did not report that they assessed treatment fidelity, and 100% failed to report fidelity outcomes.27 Furthermore, 52% of trials did not mention using a therapy manual, and 64% did not provide a reference to one that was accessible to the public.27
This lack of standardization led to the recent high-profile FDA rejection of the Lykos Therapeutics (formerly MAPS PBC) application for MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. The AdComm summary highlighted "what went wrong," focusing on concerns about trial conduct, therapist-patient boundary issues, and the challenge of "unmasking" or unblinding in studies where the drug's effects are unmistakable.28 The "unmasking" problem remains a pervasive challenge, as it may lead to overestimated effect sizes due to participant expectation bias.29
Benchmarking and Collective Intelligence
To overcome the challenges of trial design and improve outcomes, the psychedelic field is turning to benchmarking tools and "collective intelligence" (CI) frameworks. These systems leverage the wisdom of both practitioners and patients to create standardized models of care.
The Psychedelic Preparedness Scale (PPS)
The PPS is a 20-item psychometrically validated tool that represents a significant advancement in "benchmarking" patient readiness.14 Developed using the "DelFo" (Delphi-Focus) methodology—which integrates expert clinician input with the lived experience of users—the scale identifies four factors of preparedness.14 The PPS has been adopted by over ten retreat centers and facilitator training programs, allowing them to:
	•	Systematically assess readiness before a session.
	•	Tailor preparation protocols (such as the 21-day Digital Intervention for Psychedelic Preparation or DIPP).
	•	Compare data across studies to identify best practices.14
Collective Intelligence and Oneness Research
CI methodologies like "Interactive Management" (IM) are being used to map complex qualitative experiences. For example, IM has been applied to understand "oneness" experiences, where groups of experienced practitioners generate consensus-based structural models explaining how various self-perceptions are interrelated.31 This approach moves the field toward a "hyper-modeling" framework, where the outcomes of a processing hierarchy are rendered visible and known through precision-weighted information gating.33
In the policy realm, modified Delphi methods have been used to evaluate access models for natural psychedelics, building consensus across domains like anonymous use, iteration, and feedback to inform legislative Task Forces.34 Such collective intelligence is vital for creating equitable access, particularly for BIPOC therapists and clients who may require specific safety considerations related to systemic oppression and racial trauma.35
Molecular Informatics and Receptor Profiles
At the most granular level, psychedelic therapy is driven by the interaction of ligands with specific serotonergic receptors, primarily the  receptor. Molecular informatics and computational simulations have revolutionized our understanding of these interactions.
The 5-HT2A Binding Pocket and Signaling Pathways
The  receptor is a member of the class A GPCR family, featuring an orthosteric binding pocket (OBP) and an extended binding pocket (EBP).37 Agonists generally fall into three scaffolds: tryptamines (e.g., psilocybin), ergolines (e.g., LSD), and phenylalkylamines (e.g., mescaline).38

Computational studies using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations have discovered a "partially-open" state of the receptor, which may inform the development of next-generation agonists.39 Furthermore, research has demonstrated that a threshold level of  activation—but not -arrestin-2 recruitment—is required to induce psychedelic-like effects, such as the head-twitch response (HTR) in mice.40 This insight allows for the rational development of non-psychedelic  agonists that might retain therapeutic benefits like neuroplasticity without the hallucinogenic experience.40
Implementation Case Study: Oregon Psilocybin Services (ORS 475A)
Oregon serves as a primary real-world laboratory for the regulated implementation of psilocybin services. Following Ballot Measure 109, the Oregon Health Authority established the Oregon Psilocybin Services (OPS) section to regulate production and provision.42
Regulatory Data and Public Accountability
The OPS Data Dashboard provides quarterly updates on demographics, sales, and safety.43 This initiative is unique in its focus on accountability and public safety, requiring service centers to report data that will be published annually starting in 2025.44
	•	Licensing and Compliance: Every product is tracked from manufacture through ORELAP-accredited testing labs to service centers.46
	•	Adverse Reactions: In early reports, OPS recorded two severe behavioral reactions, three medical reactions, and one post-session reaction, providing critical transparency for a nascent industry.44
	•	Access Barriers: Local government regulations (such as those in Beaverton) and high costs remain themes in public listening sessions, with some legislation (HB 2387) attempting to lower barriers by allowing practitioners from other boards to serve as facilitators.43
Synthesis and Strategic Outlook
The psychedelic research landscape is characterized by a high volume of Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, a projected $10 billion market, and a growing emphasis on Real-World Evidence. However, the field is constrained by significant "failure data" related to reporting quality, treatment fidelity, and participant diversity. The "most valuable" data remains a moving target, shifting between the acute mystical-type experience and long-term neuroanatomical changes such as hippocampal desynchronization.
The future of psychedelic therapy will likely depend on the integration of molecular informatics with collective intelligence frameworks like the PPS to standardize the "patient journey." By addressing reporting gaps and utilizing RWE from dashboards like Oregon’s, the field can refine its protocols and ensure that the "psychedelic renaissance" leads to safe, standardized, and effective treatments for the millions of individuals suffering from treatment-resistant mental health conditions.
Ultimately, the goal is to move beyond "breakthrough designation" toward a sustainable medical model. This will require a focus on precision medicine—utilizing receptor-biased agonists for those who cannot tolerate the "trip"—and person-centered models of care that prioritize the preparation and integration phases as much as the dosing session itself. The data suggests that while the molecule provides the spark, the psychological and neuroplastic "window" it opens is where the lasting transformation occurs.
