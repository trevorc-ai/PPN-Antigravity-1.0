Publicly available data repositories for psychedelic research range from high-resolution molecular and neuroimaging databases to large-scale longitudinal surveys and curated industry trackers.
General Scientific and Open-Access Repositories
Researchers frequently utilize general-purpose scientific repositories to store and share datasets related to psychedelic clinical trials and observational studies.
	•	Open Science Framework (OSF): A common repository for pre-registrations, protocols, and supplemental data.[1, 2]
	•	Dryad, figshare, and Zenodo: Trusted platforms for depositing various forms of raw and processed research data.[1, 2]
	•	Harvard Dataverse and Kaggle: Host specialized datasets, such as consolidated psychotropic drug information for statistical analysis.
	•	FAIRsharing and Re3Data: These serve as registries to help investigators identify the most suitable specialized repositories for specific types of biomedical or environmental science data.[3]
Neuroimaging and Brain Data
	•	OpenNeuro: The primary open-access platform for neuroimaging data, hosting psychedelic-specific datasets like PsiConnect, which includes fMRI and EEG records.
	•	NEMAR: An OpenNeuro portal specifically designed for the visualization and analysis of high-resolution MEG, iEEG, and EEG data.
	•	Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC): Includes multimodal MRI datasets (multimodal 3T) with integrated psychometric and demographic variables.
Pharmacological and Molecular Informatics
	•	NIMH PDSP Ki Database: Directed by Dr. Bryan Roth, the Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) provides a comprehensive database of radioligand binding assays and Ki values for psychedelic compounds across various serotonin receptor subtypes.[4, 5]
	•	PASS Online: Used to predict pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action for novel antidepressant and antipsychotic molecules.[6]
Survey and Citizen Science Repositories
Large datasets capturing real-world use and self-reported outcomes are increasingly centralized in these locations:
	•	NSIHT (National Survey Investigating Hallucinogenic Trends): Managed by Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety (RMPDS), this is the largest ongoing, nationally representative survey of adult psychedelic use in the U.S., tracking behavior, benefits, and harms.
	•	microdose.me: Conducted via the Quantified Citizen app, this observational study of over 33,000 participants provides data on the effects of microdosing on mental health and cognitive performance.
	•	RAY (Research Accelerated by You): A platform that hosts the Global Ibogaine Patient Survey, aggregating real-world evidence from thousands of individuals regarding addiction treatment outcomes.[7, 8, 9]
	•	Erowid and Bluelight: Open-access digital archives containing tens of thousands of user-submitted experience reports that are frequently utilized by academic researchers for qualitative analysis.[10, 11, 12]
Curated Databases and Meta-Analysis Platforms
	•	SYPRES (Living Systematic Reviews): Maintained by the Metapsy collaboration, this repository provides continuously updated meta-analyses and clinical evidence synthesis for psychedelic treatments.[13]
	•	Psychedelic Alpha Data Bank: A curated window into formerly disparate data, including patent filings, legalization initiatives, and lobbying activity.
	•	Blossom Analysis "Originals": A database where all data points on psilocybin, LSD, DMT, and ayahuasca research are made publicly available for download.
Trial Registries and Regulatory Sources
	•	ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP: The global standards for registering clinical trials, providing information on study protocols, recruitment status, and primary endpoints for ongoing psychedelic research.[14, 2, 15]
	•	Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and Colorado CDPHE: State-regulated systems that mandate the collection of de-identified health outcome data for all supervised sessions conducted under Oregon’s Measure 109 and Colorado’s Proposition 122.[16, 17, 18]
