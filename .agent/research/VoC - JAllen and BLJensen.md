Top public pain points and desired outcomes I can substantiate from open sources:

1. Legal exposure and enforcement risk around psilocybin related practice (raids, warrants, criminal charges, loss of materials).
2. Credibility and trust problems (licensed clinical care vs spiritual framing, credential skepticism, public backlash).
3. Safety, screening, and harm reduction standards (how to run sessions responsibly, what “safe” actually means).
4. Measurement and proof (how to track outcomes, what scales to use, how to document without creating new liability).
5. Reimbursement and operating reality (coverage limits, high costs, regulatory burden).
6. Adjacent “evidence based” positioning (supplements and supportive interventions, misinformation fatigue, quality control).

Also: the “alternatives to CoStar” line is a mismatch for this audience. If your underlying intent is “alternatives to expensive, opaque, incumbent data platforms,” the correct analogue here is outcomes measurement, registries, and defensible documentation, not real estate data.

# Scope and method

## What I reviewed (publicly accessible)

* Coverage and transcripts about Singularism and its legal conflict in Utah, including an interview transcript on KJZZ and a federal court order PDF. ([KJZZ][1])
* Public marketing language on Psychedelic Therapy Journey. ([Psychedelic Therapy Journey][2])
* Public profile language for Julian Varela on Psychology Today. 
* Public bio language for Dr. Jason Allen on Reasonable Remedies. ([Singularism][3])
* Practitioner-adjacent, higher-authority sources on ethics, malpractice risk, reimbursement realities, and outcomes measurement challenges (peer reviewed, PubMed indexed, or trade medical). ([PMC][4])
* Reddit threads where commenters discuss Singularism and its founder (useful for objections and distrust triggers, but not “ground truth”). ([Reddit][5])

## Limits you should not ignore

* I cannot reliably access full LinkedIn post histories and closed communities, so “what they talk about” here is constrained to open web content.
* For Dr. Jason Allen and Julian Varela, I did not find public psychedelic-specific technical writing from them. Their available public language is broader (supplements and general therapy). ([Singularism][3])

# Person-by-person VoC

## Bridger Lee Jensen

### What he is publicly talking about

* A religious framework using psilocybin as sacrament, and the legal fight around law enforcement action (warrants, seizure of psilocybin and “scriptures,” later criminal charges). ([KJZZ][1])
* The tension between “religious use” and “clinical sounding” positioning, including explicit statements about “safe” supervised experiences and control of substances on-site. ([KJZZ][1])

### Pain points and friction signals (from his environment, not just his narrative)

High-frequency pain points, because they show up across multiple source types (court record, news transcript, public debate):

* Law enforcement intrusion risk: seizure of substances and written records is framed as a core harm. ([KJZZ][1])
* Legitimacy and trust gap: public commenters fixate on licensing, ethics, and whether the work is “unlicensed therapy dressed up as religion.” ([Reddit][5])
* Messaging whiplash: “religious exemption” plus “clinical expertise” language triggers skepticism, and critics argue it harms broader legalization efforts. ([Reddit][5])

### Desired solutions and “transformations” implied by his language

* A durable legal pathway for entheogenic practice in a conservative jurisdiction, plus public legitimacy. ([KJZZ][1])
* A “safe and effective” framed pathway that can be explained to outsiders (public officials, media, potential participants). ([KJZZ][1])

### Recurring phrases and keyword cues

From open sources tied to this situation:

* Short-tail: psilocybin, sacrament, entheogenic, religious freedom, search warrant, controlled environment, screening, integration, safety.
* Long-tail: “religious freedom law + psilocybin,” “psilocybin church raid,” “seizure of scriptures,” “screening before ceremonies,” “safe supervised psilocybin experience.” ([KJZZ][1])

## Dr. Jason Allen (Reasonable Remedies)

### What he is publicly talking about

* Evidence-based supplements, anchored in public health, epidemiology, and clinical research, positioned as “educator and scientist.” ([Singularism][3])

### Pain points implied by that positioning (inference, but grounded)

When someone leads with “evidence-based supplements” and “public health,” they are usually pushing against:

* Consumer mistrust and misinformation fatigue in supplements.
* Quality and substantiation problems (what works, what is marketing).
* The need to translate research into operational product decisions. ([Singularism][3])

### Desired solutions and outcomes implied

* Higher-quality decision-making based on evidence, not influencer claims.
* Clear standards for formulation and claims that can survive scrutiny. ([Singularism][3])

### Keyword cues

* Short-tail: evidence-based, epidemiology, clinical research, supplements, public health.
* Long-tail: “evidence-based supplement formulation,” “clinical research informed supplements.” ([Singularism][3])

## Julian J Varela (Ventura, CA)

### What he is publicly talking about

* Practical, results-driven therapy for stress, anxiety, ADHD, burnout, relationship struggles, and life transitions. 
* His language is client-outcome oriented rather than psychedelic-specific in the accessible profile. 

### Pain points reflected in his “market facing” language

This is not his personal pain, it is the pain he is signaling he helps with:

* People feeling overloaded (stress, burnout, anxiety).
* Functional impairment and relationship strain.
* Big transitions (career change, health challenges). 

### Desired transformations (as marketed)

* Practical improvement, measurable progress, better daily functioning, better relationships. 

### Keyword cues

* Short-tail: stress, anxiety, ADHD, burnout, relationships, life transition.
* Long-tail: “results-driven therapy for burnout,” “therapy for anxiety and ADHD,” “help with life transition.”

# Cross-cutting VoC themes for similar psychedelic practitioners

This is the “shared gravity” I see when you zoom out beyond the three individuals, using higher-authority practitioner-facing sources.

## Theme 1: “How do I practice ethically and legally while clients are already doing this?”

* Therapists face real uncertainty about what is allowed and what is ethical when psychedelics are involved, even when they are not administering substances. ([PMC][4])

Common question forms:

* “What can I say, document, or recommend without crossing a legal line?”
* “How do I support integration without implying I am providing illegal psychedelic-assisted therapy?” ([PMC][4])

## Theme 2: Malpractice and standard-of-care anxiety

* Physicians and clinicians worry about liability exposure and how “standard of care” will be interpreted as psychedelic modalities expand. ([PubMed][6])

Common question forms:

* “What is my malpractice exposure if something goes wrong?”
* “What documentation protects me, and what documentation creates risk?” ([PubMed][6])

## Theme 3: Outcomes measurement is messy in real life

* Even in ketamine research contexts, selection and outcome scale choice is a known challenge, which mirrors the practitioner reality: what do we measure, how often, and how do we interpret it? ([PubMed][7])

Common question forms:

* “Which scales do we use, PHQ-9, GAD-7, PTSD measures, something else?”
* “How do we measure progress without burdening staff and patients?” ([PubMed][7])

## Theme 4: Reimbursement and operating reality

* Coverage remains limited and inconsistent, which creates operational constraints and pushes clinics into cash-pay models with pricing pressure. ([AJMC][8])

Common question forms:

* “What can be billed, preparation, integration, administration, none of it?”
* “How do we keep this accessible without breaking the clinic?” ([AJMC][8])

# What this means for your PPN marketing and product decisions

If your goal is to recruit serious practitioners, you should lean into the problems they already obsess over:

1. Risk and defensibility
   They worry about liability and boundaries, so your language should emphasize “ethical practice support,” “documentation discipline,” and “quality improvement,” not hype. ([PMC][4])

2. Measurement without bureaucracy
   The outcomes question is real, and the scale-selection problem is real. Your pitch wins if you simplify the measurement burden while increasing credibility. ([PubMed][7])

3. Trust signals
   The Bridger-related backlash shows how quickly credibility collapses when the public senses ambiguity about credentials or intent. Your onboarding and positioning should make credentials, governance, and boundaries explicit. ([Reddit][5])

1. Entheogenic religion operators (psilocybin)

* They want durable legal footing, predictable operations, and legitimacy that survives scrutiny.
* The transformation: from “high-risk, ad hoc ceremonies” to “standardized, documented, defensible practice that can scale.”

2. Licensed clinics (ketamine plus regulated programs)

* They want measurable outcomes, fewer safety events, lower admin burden, and a credible path to reimbursement or payer partnership.
* The transformation: from “cash-pay, inconsistent protocols, weak measurement” to “outcomes-driven care with audit-ready documentation and payer-grade evidence.”

# Outcome and transformation map

## Segment A: Entheogenic religion operators using psilocybin

This segment lives or dies on legal durability and legitimacy. They do not just need “better results.” They need survivability.

### Core outcomes they actually care about (ranked)

1. Legal defensibility

* Outcome: they can show a coherent, consistent, repeatable religious practice and controls around sacrament handling.
* Why it matters: stakeholders report barriers and unclear timelines in the federal petition process, which increases uncertainty and risk. ([GAO][1])

2. Lower enforcement disruption risk

* Outcome: fewer catastrophic interruptions (raids, seizures, prosecutions, forced shutdowns).
* Transformation: from fear-based, reactive operations to proactive risk controls and documentation discipline.
* Context: federal reporting highlights enforcement and exemption barriers as central issues for this population. ([GAO][2])

3. Legitimacy with outsiders (press, attorneys, local officials, potential members)

* Outcome: their public narrative sounds credible, not evasive.
* Transformation: from “people assume this is a loophole” to “people can understand the governance, safety, and boundaries.”

4. Safety and incident containment

* Outcome: fewer severe adverse incidents and faster, cleaner response when something happens.
* Transformation: from informal screening and inconsistent support to standardized screening, documentation, escalation, and aftercare.

5. Operational continuity and scalability

* Outcome: they can train facilitators consistently, run sessions consistently, and expand without quality collapsing.

6. Reputation resilience

* Outcome: fewer public credibility collapses triggered by unclear credentialing or sloppy operations.
* Transformation: from “controversy defines us” to “standards define us.”

### What they say in plain language (VoC-style statements)

* “We need a way to operate that does not put our whole community at risk.”
* “We need documentation that protects us, not documentation that creates more exposure.”
* “We need consistent screening and safety practices so one bad incident does not end the organization.”
* “We need legitimacy, not hype.”

### Their “proof” requirements

They need proof that reduces perceived legal and reputational risk:

* Consistency over time (repeatable process)
* Clear role boundaries (who does what)
* Records that show control and intent (not therapy cosplay)

Relevant reference points for their environment

* U.S. Government Accountability Office reports barriers and unclear timing in exemption processing for psilocybin religious practice petitions. ([GAO][1])
* Drug Enforcement Administration publishes RFRA petition guidance, which shapes what petitioners must produce. ([DEA Diversion Control Division][3])

## Segment B: Licensed clinics offering ketamine and other regulated programs

This segment lives or dies on outcomes evidence, safety, and economics. They want to prove value without drowning staff in paperwork.

### Core outcomes they actually care about (ranked)

1. Measurable patient outcomes that translate into business outcomes

* Outcome: better response rates, fewer drop-offs, better durability.
* Transformation: from subjective “patients feel better” to standardized measurement you can defend.

2. A credible path to broader coverage

* Outcome: less friction with payers, fewer denials, more predictable revenue, or at minimum fewer refund fights and disputes.
* Context: clinician networks and peer-reviewed pieces explicitly argue for insurance coverage and emphasize real-world evidence as a lever. ([National Network of Depression Centers][4])

3. Lower safety and compliance risk

* Outcome: fewer adverse events, better screening, clean documentation.
* Transformation: from “clinic-by-clinic improvisation” to “standard-of-care aware operations.”

4. Lower admin burden per treated patient

* Outcome: staff spend less time chasing forms and more time delivering care.
* Transformation: from “manual and inconsistent workflow” to “structured, light-touch data capture.”

5. Higher capacity utilization and predictable throughput

* Outcome: fewer no-shows, better scheduling efficiency, better unit economics.
* Context: industry reporting highlights access challenges and administrative hurdles, including insurance friction, as constraints for clinics. ([Fierce Healthcare][5])

6. Audit-ready documentation

* Outcome: they can answer hard questions fast, from payers, regulators, malpractice carriers, and referral partners.

7. Benchmarking that actually changes decisions

* Outcome: they can compare across providers or sites and identify what improves outcomes and what increases risk.
* Transformation: from “opinions” to “operating decisions based on data.”

### What they say in plain language (VoC-style statements)

* “We need to prove this works in our real patients, not just in studies.”
* “We need fewer denials and less paperwork.”
* “We need consistent screening so we do not treat the wrong people.”
* “We need outcomes tracking that does not slow the clinic down.”
* “We need to show quality, not just volume.”

### Regulated program overlay (example: state psilocybin programs)

Regulated programs add a second layer: reporting obligations and high operating costs.

Outcomes they care about:

* Compliance without chaos (required forms, incident reporting, retention of records)
* Lower cost per session delivered, because high costs drive closures and low access
* Demonstrable safety record that supports program legitimacy and reduces local bans

Context:

* Oregon Health Authority requires documentation and reporting on adverse reactions in its psilocybin services rules and forms. ([Oregon][6])
* Oregon’s program shows financial and regulatory strain, with service center closures and high session costs reported by multiple outlets. ([opb][7])

# Keywords and search phrases that map to these outcomes

## Entheogenic religion operators (psilocybin)

* “RFRA religious exemption petition DEA”
* “psilocybin religious exemption process timeframe”
* “controlled substances religious practice compliance”
* “psilocybin sacrament governance safety screening”
* “religious liberty psilocybin legal protections” ([GAO][1])

## Licensed clinics (ketamine, regulated programs)

* “insurance coverage intravenous ketamine treatment resistant depression”
* “real-world evidence ketamine outcomes”
* “ketamine clinic documentation outcomes measures”
* “ketamine prior authorization outcomes tracking”
* “psilocybin services adverse reaction reporting requirements” ([PubMed][8])

# Strategic implication for your B2B positioning

If you want practitioners to buy, you should sell the transformation they want, not the features you built.

* For psilocybin religion operators: sell operational defensibility and legitimacy. Do not sell “legal immunity.”
* For ketamine and regulated programs: sell outcomes proof plus reduced admin burden. Tie outcomes tracking to reimbursement readiness and risk reduction. ([PubMed][9])
