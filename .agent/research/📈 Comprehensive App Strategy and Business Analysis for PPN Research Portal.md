Comprehensive App Strategy and Business Analysis for PPN Research Portal
Executive summary
Elevator pitch
PPN Research Portal is a practitioner-only outcomes registry and real-world evidence (RWE) platform for psychedelic treatments, starting with ketamine clinics and training cohorts. It captures structured, de-identified, session-level treatment data and generates decision-grade benchmarks across sites for risk mitigation, quality improvement, and practice pattern learning.
The wedge is not “protocol advice.” The wedge is “audit-ready, benchmarkable operations” in a field where practice varies widely and liability anxiety is high. PPN’s defensibility comes from the “zero-knowledge” posture, meaning you do not store patient identifiers and you constrain data to coded, comparable elements that can be shared safely at aggregate levels.
This aligns with two powerful market realities: - Regulated or quasi-regulated psychedelic delivery models are emerging and force standardization. Oregon’s psilocybin program is explicit about preparation requirements, transportation and safety plans, and written consents, including supportive touch consent and secondary dose consent. [1] - Regulated psychedelic-adjacent care already sets a monitoring benchmark. Spravato REMS requires administration under direct observation and at least two hours of monitoring, and Spravato must not be dispensed for home use. [2]
Viability in one sentence
This is viable if, and only if, you can make “data contribution” easy enough that clinics contribute consistently, and “benchmark outputs” valuable enough that clinics keep paying.
North Star metric
North Star metric: Benchmark-ready episodes per month.
Definition: - An “episode” is benchmark-ready when it has (1) a baseline outcome measure, (2) at least one defined follow-up timepoint, (3) a coded exposure record (substance, route, dose unit), (4) a coded setting and support structure, and (5) coded safety event capture (at least “none reported” versus coded event).
Why this is the right North Star: - Benchmarks require comparable denominators, not anecdotes. - It measures the core value creation loop, data in, decision-grade benchmark out.
Candid outlook
Your biggest risk is not technical. Your biggest risk is adoption friction and trust. Most clinics will not do “research-grade data entry” unless the platform saves them time, reduces perceived liability, improves outcomes reporting, or supports payer conversations. That means your product must deliver visible operational value in the first two weeks of setup, not in six months.
Market analysis
Target market framing
PPN is a B2B SaaS platform selling to: - Clinic owners and site directors - Medical directors - Operational leads responsible for compliance, training, and outcomes reporting
The platform is strategically aligned with two expanding categories: - Ketamine clinic and interventional psychiatry markets, which include in-clinic and remote models and have increasing scrutiny around safety and standards. - State-regulated psychedelic service models and training ecosystems, which need standardized documentation and defensible operational workflows. [3]
TAM, SAM, SOM
Because “psychedelic clinics” are not a clean NAICS category, the most honest market sizing is scenario-based. Below are two ways to frame it: a “site-based TAM” and a “revenue-adjacent TAM.”
TAM: Site-based “addressable sites” in the US
Anchor facts you can cite: - One report cites roughly 1,200 to 1,500 ketamine clinics operating in the US. [4] - A 2025 report cites Johnson & Johnson’s tally of about 3,000 outpatient treatment centers certified to administer Spravato. [5]
Reality adjustment: - These populations overlap. Many sites that provide ketamine also provide Spravato. You should not add them blindly.
TAM assumption (conservative): - 3,500 unique US “interventional mood treatment sites” relevant to PPN in the next 3 to 5 years.
TAM in ARR terms (software only, not treatment revenue): - If average site subscription is $600 per month, then TAM ARR ≈ 3,500 × $600 × 12 = $25.2M.
This is a sober TAM. It is not a “billion-dollar SaaS TAM.” If you want venture-scale outcomes, you either: - expand internationally, - expand into broader behavioral health measurement-based care (MBC), or - move into payer-facing outcomes contracting and RWE data products after network maturity.
SAM: Serviceable available market (next 24 months)
Practical service boundaries: - Clinics that already track outcomes or care about standardization, which is every well-run ketamine clinic, most Spravato-certified centers, and training cohorts that want credibility.
SAM assumption: - 400 to 800 sites as the realistically serviceable US market for early adoption in 24 months (based on your ability to sell, onboard, and support, not the “existence” of sites).
SOM: Serviceable obtainable market (next 24 months)
SOM is constrained by: - your sales motion and onboarding throughput, - trust building and liability pain, - measurable proof of value.
SOM assumption (realistic): - 50 to 150 paying sites by month 24, with 5 to 20 multi-site operators or cohort programs as anchor customers.
Competitive landscape
In this market, competitors are defined by “who already owns practitioner workflows and outcomes reporting,” not by who says “psychedelic.”
Direct competitors (closest overlap with your value proposition) - Osmind[6]: A psychiatry-tailored EHR with outcomes and Spravato REMS integration, priced starting at $249 per clinician per month. This competes directly because it already sits where data is generated and it bundles insurance and reporting workflows for many practices. [7] - Journey Clinical[8]: A platform that supports therapists adding ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, including screening, prescribing, and outcome monitoring via its portal, plus a large therapist network. This competes because it combines workflow plus outcomes capture and can become a de facto data standard inside its network. [9] - Greenspace Health[10]: A measurement-based care platform positioned around outcome tracking, benchmarking, and clinical decision support. This competes because MBC platforms are the default “outcomes infrastructure” purchase for many behavioral health organizations. [11]
Indirect competitors (they win when your buyer chooses “do nothing new”) - Epic Systems[12]: Dominant EHR ecosystems and their analytic layers can absorb outcome tracking and reporting, especially when large health systems decide to keep everything inside their EHR stack. [13] - TriNetX[14] and Aetion[15]: Large RWE platforms sell evidence generation to life sciences and payers, and they are a credible “end state competitor” if psychedelic RWE becomes mainstream and pharma-funded. They are not direct workflow competitors today, but they define what “regulatory-grade RWE” looks like. [16]
Blue Ocean strategy
Your blue ocean is the intersection of: - psychedelic treatment-specific exposure structure, - cross-site peer benchmarking, - safety signal reporting, - no-PHI data posture, - and “quality improvement” framing that is operationally useful.
In plain terms: Most tools are either: - workflow and billing systems that store PHI and are heavy to adopt, or - generic MBC tools that do not understand psychedelic exposure and protocol variability.
Your space: A lightweight, protocol-aware registry and benchmarking layer that clinics can adopt without EHR integration and without storing identity.
The advantage is strongest in environments with explicit operational rules: - Oregon requires structured preparation steps, safety and support planning, transportation planning, and specific written consents. This creates a natural data model and a powerful “compliance-oriented” value proposition. [1] - Colorado is formalizing facilitator training requirements including content on boundaries and physical touch, contraindications, trauma-informed care, and suicide risk. This creates institutional pressure for standardized training and reporting. [17]
Business model and monetization
Revenue streams
Short-term revenue streams (0 to 12 months) The goal in year one is cash flow and product proof, not “scale.”
	•	Paid pilots with “give-to-get” terms
	•	Clinics pay a reduced pilot fee, but must submit minimum benchmark-ready episodes monthly to retain access to network benchmarks.
	•	This solves your core risk, which is sparse data.
	•	Onboarding and implementation fees
	•	Charge for protocol mapping, outcomes setup, and staff training.
	•	This is high-margin early revenue, and it aligns incentives.
	•	Compliance and quality improvement reporting packages
	•	Especially relevant for Spravato REMS-style operational culture, where monitoring requirements are clear and documentation burden is real. [2]
	•	Do not claim you satisfy REMS program reporting unless you explicitly do. You can sell “internal reporting readiness” without claiming regulatory substitution.
	•	Training cohort partnerships
	•	Colorado’s DORA-approved training ecosystem has explicit curriculum requirements and ongoing compliance expectations. There is an opportunity to sell cohort-level outcomes tracking and quality reporting to training programs and their practicum sites. [18]
Long-term revenue streams (1 to 5 years) This is where scalability matters.
	•	SaaS subscriptions per site, tiered by analytics depth and benchmarking access
	•	Multi-site operator enterprise licensing
	•	Network benchmark add-on
	•	Sponsored research collaborations
	•	Only after your dataset is mature and governance is defensible, because “data monetization” triggers reputational and legal scrutiny.
	•	If you pursue RWE partnerships later, understand that “regulatory-grade evidence” vendors exist and set expectations. [19]
Pricing strategy
Use market anchors: - An EHR like Osmind starts at $249 per clinician per month. That defines one benchmark for what interventional psychiatry clinics already tolerate for software spend. [7]
Recommended tiers (USD) This is intentionally simple and revenue-focused.

Data monetization caution
Be ruthless here: - “We will monetize data” is not a strategy. It is a liability magnet. - If you announce data monetization early, high-quality clinics get nervous and stop contributing. - A safer framing is “aggregate benchmarking and quality improvement reporting,” aligned to de-identification standards. [20]
SWOT analysis
Strengths
	•	Strong wedge in a high-variance care space where practitioners demand defensible standards.
	•	Clear privacy-first posture aligned with HIPAA de-identification Safe Harbor constraints, especially the restriction that dates cannot be more specific than year under Safe Harbor. [20]
	•	Regulatory signals are pushing the field toward standardized processes, which is where registries win.
	•	Oregon’s program explicitly defines preparation and keeps a consistent cadence of consent and documentation requirements. [1]
	•	Colorado’s program defines training, CE, and content requirements that reinforce the need for structured practice. [21]
Weaknesses
	•	Network-effect products die if data entry is heavy. You must win on workflow simplicity.
	•	You risk confusion about what “zero-knowledge” means. In cryptography, it implies a specific class of proofs. In your context it is “no PHI stored,” and you must define it precisely to avoid reputational risk.
	•	Hard to sell “benchmarks” before you have enough data to make benchmarks meaningful.
Opportunities
	•	Growing ketamine clinic market and continued expansion of interventional psychiatry, supported by market analyses projecting growth in ketamine clinic revenues. [22]
	•	Growing scrutiny of at-home and loosely monitored ketamine models creates demand for better standards and outcomes transparency. [4]
	•	New state-regulated psychedelic programs create standardized operational models that lend themselves to structured registries.
	•	Oregon is operating and evolving the rules. [23]
	•	Colorado is building training and licensure requirements and auditing compliance. [24]
Threats
	•	Regulatory volatility and reputational shocks. The FDA rejection of MDMA-assisted therapy and subsequent need for more Phase 3 evidence show how quickly sentiment and investment can shift. [25]
	•	Entrenched workflow competitors (EHRs and MBC platforms) can bundle outcomes tracking into existing contracts.
	•	A single privacy incident could kill the project, especially if you position as “liability shield.”
Go-to-market strategy
Getting the first 1,000 users
Your first 1,000 users should not be “patients.” They should be: - 50 to 150 clinics and cohorts, each contributing 5 to 20 practitioners. - You win by landing sites, not individuals.
Organic acquisition - Training cohorts and practicum ecosystems - Colorado’s training and program requirements generate a natural channel if you can position PPN as “evidence and quality infrastructure.” [26] - Content marketing that maps to practitioner intent - “How to structure outcomes tracking for ketamine and psychedelic-adjacent care” - “Safety signal dashboards and adverse event coding” - “Benchmark methodology and suppression rules” - Partner with professional organizations and education events - The strongest partnerships are those that standardize practice, because PPN becomes the “reporting layer.”
Paid acquisition Use paid acquisition only for: - Scheduling demos with clinic owners and ops leads. - Retargeting visitors who read your method pages.
Do not buy mass clicks yet. Until you have proof that sites activate and contribute data, paid acquisition will amplify churn.
Virality and network effects
Your mechanism is “give-to-get,” not invites.
	•	Benchmarks improve when more sites contribute comparable data.
	•	Make benchmarks a gated reward:
	•	No contribution, no network percentile outputs.
	•	Create “benchmark badges” for clinic marketing:
	•	Example: “We report standardized outcomes and participate in a peer benchmark network.”
	•	Keep this factual. Do not imply superiority without statistical backing.
Mechanics to institutionalize referrals - Each site admin can invite other sites into the network with a structured referral: - Invite includes your governance summary, data fields list, and suppression policy. - Training cohorts become referral engines: - Graduates want legitimacy. Registries offer legitimacy.
Technical and operational feasibility
MVP scope
MVP features that are mandatory at launch - Site onboarding and access control (RLS-based tenancy) - Session-level exposure capture - Substance, route, dose amount, dose unit - Baseline and follow-up outcomes capture with standardized instruments - For example, PHQ-9 total score has a defined LOINC code and score range, which supports comparability. [27] - Safety event logging using a controlled taxonomy - Site-only dashboards - Funnel, follow-up compliance, outcome delta - Network benchmark engine v1 - Aggregates only, with small-cell suppression - Audit trail for data access and exports
Features that can wait - Full EHR integrations - Wearables ingestion - Advanced ML prediction, until you have clean data and enough volume - Payer contracting and claims workflows
Tech stack recommendation
You already aligned on a Postgres-based, RLS-centered architecture. Keep it.
Core stack recommendation - Frontend: React + Next.js + Tailwind - Backend: Supabase[28] with Postgres, RLS policies, Edge Functions for controlled aggregation - Analytics: Postgres views and materialized views, with strict suppression logic in SQL - ETL: Minimal. Do not overbuild. Only add ingestion once core capture works.
Interoperability and vocabularies Do not implement “FHIR exchange” in MVP. Implement “FHIR-compatible internal modeling” so you can export later.
Framework to follow: - Use HL7[29] FHIR resource patterns as conceptual mapping for your internal data model. QuestionnaireResponse is explicitly designed to capture structured questionnaire answers and can be validated against questionnaire constraints. [30] - Use LOINC codes for assessments where feasible. [27] - Use RxNorm for medications and medication classes if you later support medication interaction flags. [31] - Use UCUM for units. UCUM exists specifically to make unit communication unambiguous across systems. [32] - SNOMED CT licensing and distribution have specific terms. In the US, distribution is facilitated by NLM and SNOMED CT can be accessed under UMLS licensing. You must confirm licensing compliance before redistribution. [33] - Be aware that LOINC licensing and term usage has constraints and governance. An implementer must respect Regenstrief licensing terms and redistribution rules. [34]
Operational compliance and trust anchors - Spravato REMS provides an operational reference model for monitoring and site certification expectations. Patients must be observed at least two hours and the drug must not be dispensed for home use. [35] - Your platform should reflect this mindset: structured monitoring indicators, defined workflows, and clear documentation fields, without storing PHI.
Pre-mortem risk assessment
Imagine PPN Research Portal failed by February 2028. The three most likely causes and how to prevent them now:
Failure reason 1: The network never hits “benchmark density”
What happens - You sign pilots, but sites do not consistently submit benchmark-ready episodes. - Benchmarks stay thin, suppression hides most outputs, and customers churn.
Root drivers - Data entry burden - Unclear “give-to-get” contract - Clinicians do not see immediate outputs
Prevention actions now - Design the MVP around the North Star metric and show “benchmark readiness” progress to admins weekly. - Enforce contribution requirements for access to network benchmarks. - Provide immediate value in week one: site-only delta charts and completeness heatmaps.
Failure reason 2: Privacy incident or credibility breach
What happens - A user enters PHI in a field you did not constrain. - Or a cross-site slice reveals a small cohort. - You lose trust, and participation collapses.
Prevention actions now - Enforce no free-text answers in all patient-referenced logs. - Apply Safe Harbor constraints strictly, especially around dates. Safe Harbor requires removing all date elements except year and grouping ages over 89. [20] - Put suppression in the SQL layer, not the UI. - Make “what we do not collect” a first-class product page, linked everywhere.
Failure reason 3: Workflow incumbents bundle outcomes and win
What happens - Clinics decide to “just use our EHR outcomes module” or “just use an MBC vendor.” - Your differentiation gets blurred, and price pressure increases.
Prevention actions now - Position the product as a neutral benchmarking network with psychedelic-specific exposure modeling. - Make your protocol-aware benchmarking and safety signal dashboards demonstrably unique in demos. - Build integrations later, but start as a “thin layer” adoption path with no EHR dependency.

What information do you want to lock in for future use? - Confirm the benchmark suppression threshold (N ≥ 10, N ≥ 20, or dynamic). - Confirm initial pricing posture (paid pilot required vs mixed free and paid).
