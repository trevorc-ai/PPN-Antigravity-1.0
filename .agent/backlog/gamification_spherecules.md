title: "Gamification Strategy: Spherecules"
---

## Objective
Implement "Scientific Gamification" elements throughout the PPN Portal, utilizing generative math-based animations (referred to as "Spherecules").

## Concept
Instead of childish badges or points, PPN will use high-end, data-driven geometric light-trail animations (Amber/Orange and Electric Blue). These represent complex states of data and progression.

## Key Implementation Areas
1. **Dynamic Progress Representation:** As a practitioner completes more of the "Arc of Care" or hits data quality milestones, their clinic's central "Spherecule" avatar becomes more complex (evolving from a simple orbit to complex Lissajous curves or spirographs).
2. **Patient Wellness Milestones:** Patients on the Wellness Journey see their progress visualized not as a progress bar, but as a living, breathing geometric entity that stabilizes as their outcomes improve.
3. **The Digital "Set and Setting" (Patient Intake/Forms):** *Crucial Insight:* When a patient with PTSD or severe anxiety sits in a waiting room filling out their MEQ-30 or baseline intake on a tablet before a session, the UI must act as an extension of the therapeutic container. The animations should be slow, soothing, and use breathing rhythms (e.g., box breathing patterns or 4-7-8 timing) and cooler, meditative colors (deep deep blues, soft purples) to calm the nervous system before treatment begins.
4. **Gamified Micro-Learning (Pharmacology & Receptors):** Create interactive "Spherecule" models representing specific neuro-receptors (e.g., 5-HT2A). Practitioners and patients can interact with these 3D objects to understand binding affinities and half-lives visually, earning progress by exploring the science.
5. **Loading States:** Use simple orbital animations instead of generic spinners when fetching complex queries.
6. **Data Density:** High-quality data submissions increase the "glow" or particle count of the clinic's avatar.

## Visual Style
- Minimalist, high-energy light painting
- Deep space backgrounds (already implemented via StarField)
- Math-inspired (String theory, orbital mechanics, harmonics)
- Smooth, continuous curves
