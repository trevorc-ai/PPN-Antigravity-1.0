# PPN Legal & Regulatory Strategy Documentation

**CONFIDENTIAL – PREPARED FOR PPN ADVISORY SESSION**

## Purpose
This directory contains the foundational legal and regulatory strategy documents for the Psychedelic Practitioner Network (PPN). These documents are prepared specifically to brief external legal counsel, advisory board members, and potential investors on the structural mechanisms PPN uses to mitigate healthcare liability, protect intellectual property, and navigate the fragmented regulatory landscape of psychedelic-assisted therapy.

## Directory Contents

### `01_PPN_Zero_PHI_Architecture_Brief.md`
**The "Data Moat" Strategy**
Details PPN's technical and architectural enforcement of a "Zero-PHI" platform. This document explains the use of synthetic `Subject_ID`s, the physical segregation of PII at the clinic level, and our argument for operating entirely outside of HIPAA jurisdiction.

### `02_PPN_Regulatory_Positioning.md`
**The IP and Liability Moat**
Outlines PPN's stance on the Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM), Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), and our explicit decision to protect the platform's analytical algorithms (Outcome Engine) as Trade Secrets rather than pursuing defensive utility patents.

### `03_Advisor_Questions.md`
**Specific Counsel Requests**
A highly targeted list of "stress-test" questions designed for reviewing legal counsel or VC advisors. These questions are formulated to extract high-leverage guidance on structural de-risking, go-to-market friction (e.g., whether to build for HIPAA compliance despite the architecture), and mitigating ancillary liability in the psychedelic space.
