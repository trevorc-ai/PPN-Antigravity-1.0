# High-Leverage Advisor Questions: VC & Healthcare Law

**CONFIDENTIAL – PREPARED FOR PPN ADVISORY SESSION**

## Context
These questions are designed to extract maximum structural value from our upcoming session with a retired VC / Healthcare Attorney. They are focused on de-risking the startup from an investor’s perspective regarding our primary moats, regulatory boundaries, and go-to-market friction.

### Request for Review (Please review prior to our session)

#### 1. The Enterprise Friction Question (HIPAA & BAAs)
*We have architected PPN as a "Zero-PHI," strictly de-identified database, meaning we rely exclusively on synthetic IDs generated at the clinic level and process absolutely no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on our servers (no names, emails, DOBs).*

**Question:** Under the letter of the law, we believe we do not require HIPAA Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). However, in your experience representing enterprise health startups, do risk-averse, multi-practitioner clinics demand HIPAA compliance from their software vendors anyway, just as a matter of internal policy? Should we voluntarily over-build for full HIPAA compliance as a "Go-To-Market" sales accelerant, or would you advise us to fiercely defend our purely B2B, analytics-only, non-HIPAA stance to save massive legal/compliance fees?

#### 2. The SaMD Line in the Sand (FDA Regulation)
*Our 'Outcome Engine' aggregates the anonymized data to point out statistically significant clinical correlations (e.g., visualizing that patients with Profile A historically present a 15% higher responder rate to Protocol B than Protocol C).*

**Question:** Where exactly is the regulatory line where a purely retrospective "Clinical Decision Support Tool" or "Observational Analytics Platform" suddenly gets aggressively classified by the FDA as a regulated "Software as a Medical Device" (SaMD)? What specific phrasing in our UI or core algorithmic functionality must we avoid to ensure we never cross that line?

#### 3. The Psychedelic Liability Question (Ancillary Liability)
*We operate entirely as a B2B Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) vendor, explicitly avoiding the Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM). We do not employ practitioners or direct care.*

**Question:** Because we operate in a legally fragmented space (state-legal vs. federally-scheduled substances like Psilocybin or MDMA), is there any legal precedent of "ancillary liability" for a software company that merely provides tracking infrastructure to independent practitioners who may be operating in grey areas? As an investor looking at a Series A deal, how would you require a founder to structurally ring-fence the software layer from the clinical delivery layer?
