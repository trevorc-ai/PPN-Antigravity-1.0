# Regulatory Strategy: CPOM, SaMD & IP Moat

**CONFIDENTIAL – FOR LEGAL COUNSEL REVIEW ONLY**

## 1. Defining PPN's Regulatory Boundaries

PPN serves as "Observational Analytics" and "Clinical Decision Support" (CDS) infrastructure. We are a B2B Software Service, not a healthcare provider or a medical device.

**Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM):**
Because PPN explicitly avoids the direct employment or contracting of practitioners for the purpose of clinical service delivery, and because all PPN functions are inherently B2B transactions with independent clinical practices, PPN has structured its operations to avoid CPOM restrictions entirely. Practitioners explicitly retain 100% of the clinical judgment, risk, and liability for patient decisions. 

**Software as a Medical Device (SaMD):**
Our algorithms (like the Outcome Engine and NNT calculation) rely on historical benchmark data, not active diagnostic protocols. PPN computes and visualizes retrospective statistical realities; it does not explicitly tell a practitioner *what to prescribe* or *how to diagnose* a patient. 

We require legal feedback on the specific threshold at which a purely analytical CDS tool reporting statistically significant correlations (e.g., "Patients with Profile A responded 15% better to Protocol B") crosses into the FDA's regulatory domain as a Medical Device.

## 2. IP Strategy: The Trade Secret Moat

It is our firm internal stance to **protect 100% of our algorithmic IP and predictive models as Trade Secrets**, rather than pursuing defensive utility patents. 

**Our Rationales for Trade Secret Selection:**
1.  **Software Patent Efficacy:** Software patents are historically difficult to secure, expensive to maintain, and challenging to enforce relative to the pace of B2B SaaS innovation.
2.  **Disclosure Mitigation:** Filing patents requires publicizing the very methodologies we intend to keep proprietary. 
3.  **Nature of the Alpha:** PPN's primary competitive advantage is less about novel mathematical formulas and more about the proprietary execution, aggregation, and specific "tuning" of its models against a unique, highly siloed dataset.
4.  **Duration:** Trade secrets last indefinitely (provided secrecy is maintained), whereas patents are time-bound. 

## 3. Legal Counsel Review Request
We are requesting the following evaluation regarding these strategic positions:

1.  **Trade Secret Infrastructure:** What internal data-classification structures, employee non-competes, and vendor Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) must be meticulously enforced from day one to ensure trade secret protections hold up in the event of intellectual property theft or a key employee defection?
2.  **SaMD Triggers:** What explicit phrasing in our Terms of Service (ToS), marketing materials, or in-app UI can inadvertently trigger the FDA's classification of our Outcome Engine as an SaMD? How do we prevent this?
3.  **CPOM Liability:** While we don't employ docs, is there any risk of PPN being perceived as "directing" clinical care simply by providing ranked visualizations of clinical efficacy to independent providers?
