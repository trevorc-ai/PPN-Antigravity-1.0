# 🤝 TRIPPINGLY PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL
## Affiliate & Distribution Partnership

**For:** Trippingly.net founder  
**From:** PPN Portal Team, PPN Portal  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Type:** Affiliate partnership + content collaboration

---

## 🎯 THE OPPORTUNITY

### **The Gap:**
- Trippingly educates **consumers** about safe psychedelic use
- But consumers often ask: **"Where can I find a licensed practitioner?"**
- Currently, no good answer (Reddit, word-of-mouth, sketchy directories)

### **The Solution:**
- PPN Portal has a network of **licensed, safety-focused practitioners**
- Trippingly can connect their audience to these practitioners
- **Win-Win:** Trippingly monetizes audience, PPN gets qualified patient leads

---

## 💰 AFFILIATE PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE

### **Option 1: Referral Fee (Simple)**

**How It Works:**
1. Trippingly adds "Find a Licensed Practitioner" page
2. Lists PPN Portal practitioners (with affiliate link)
3. When Trippingly reader signs up for PPN, Trippingly gets paid

**Payout Structure:**
- **$50 per practitioner signup** (Solo tier, $49/month)
- **$100 per clinic signup** (Clinic tier, $149/month)
- **$300 per network signup** (Network tier, $499/month)

**Example Revenue:**
- 10 practitioner signups/month = $500/month
- 5 clinic signups/month = $500/month
- 2 network signups/month = $600/month
- **Total: $1,600/month passive income**

**Tracking:**
- Unique affiliate link: `ppnportal.com/signup?ref=trippingly`
- Dashboard shows clicks, signups, revenue
- Monthly payout via PayPal/Stripe

---

### **Option 2: Revenue Share (Recurring)**

**How It Works:**
1. Same as Option 1, but Trippingly gets **ongoing commission**
2. As long as practitioner stays subscribed, Trippingly earns

**Payout Structure:**
- **20% of monthly subscription** (recurring)
- Solo ($49/month) → Trippingly gets $9.80/month
- Clinic ($149/month) → Trippingly gets $29.80/month
- Network ($499/month) → Trippingly gets $99.80/month

**Example Revenue (After 12 Months):**
- 50 practitioners × $9.80/month = $490/month
- 20 clinics × $29.80/month = $596/month
- 5 networks × $99.80/month = $499/month
- **Total: $1,585/month recurring** (compounds over time)

**Why This Is Better:**
- Passive, recurring income (not one-time)
- Compounds as more practitioners join
- Aligns incentives (Trippingly wants practitioners to succeed)

---

### **Option 3: Hybrid (Best of Both)**

**How It Works:**
1. **Upfront:** $50 referral fee (immediate payout)
2. **Recurring:** 10% revenue share (ongoing)

**Example:**
- Practitioner signs up → Trippingly gets $50 immediately
- Practitioner stays subscribed → Trippingly gets $4.90/month ongoing
- After 10 months, Trippingly has earned $99 total (vs. $50 one-time)

**Why This Works:**
- Immediate cash flow (upfront fee)
- Long-term passive income (revenue share)
- Best of both worlds
