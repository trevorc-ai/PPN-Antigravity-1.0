## 🎬 SCENE 1: HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

### **Visual:**
- Black screen
- White text fades in, centered

### **Text Overlay:**
```
"Research progress is hampered by 
lack of comparable data...

Impossible to compare protocols or outcomes."

— Dr. Shena Jaramillo
Bend Ketamine Clinic
```

### **Voiceover:**
> "Dr. Shena Jaramillo has been practicing psychedelic therapy for over a decade. And she's not alone in this frustration."

### **Music:**
- Subtle, professional (not dramatic)
- Builds anticipation

---

## 🎬 SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:45)

### **Visual:**
- Split screen showing 4 different practitioners
- Each using different tools (Excel, paper forms, different EHRs)
- Overlays showing: "No common framework" "Isolated decisions" "Fragmented data"

### **Text Overlay:**
```
The Current Reality:

❌ No common data collection framework
❌ Each practitioner using different tools
❌ Impossible to compare protocols
❌ No way to identify best practices
```

### **Voiceover:**
> "Right now, every practitioner is working in isolation. Different assessment tools. Different protocols. No way to know what's working across the field. It's like practicing medicine in the dark."

### **Music:**
- Slightly tense (problem state)

---

## 🎬 SCENE 3: THE SOLUTION (0:45 - 1:30)

### **Visual:**
- Fade to clean interface
- Show split-screen Protocol Builder
- Left side: Practitioner entering patient data
- Right side: Live data visualization appearing

### **Text Overlay:**
```
Introducing:
PPN Research Portal

The Clinical Intelligence Platform
```

### **Voiceover:**
> "We built something different. Not an EHR. Not practice management. A clinical intelligence platform."

---

### **Visual Sequence:**

**0:45 - 0:55: Input Panel**
- Show practitioner entering:
  - Age: 36-45
  - Indication: Major Depressive Disorder
  - Proposed protocol: Ketamine 0.5mg/kg IV

**0:55 - 1:05: Data Panel Updates (Real-Time)**
- Right panel animates:
  - "Similar Patients: N=127"
  - "68% significant improvement"
  - "24% moderate improvement"

**1:05 - 1:15: Receptor Impact**
- Show receptor visualization:
  - NMDA: 80% antagonism
  - AMPA: 60% activation
  - mTOR: 40% pathway activity

**1:15 - 1:25: Safety Alert**
- Amber alert appears:
  - "⚠️ Interaction Detected"
  - "Benzodiazepines may reduce efficacy (23%)"

**1:25 - 1:30: Network Benchmarks**
- Show comparison:
  - "Your clinic: 72% success"
  - "Network average: 68% success"
  - "You're performing ABOVE average ✅"

### **Voiceover (during sequence):**
> "As you design a protocol, you see in real-time what happened to similar patients. Receptor targets. Safety alerts. Network benchmarks. Every decision informed by collective intelligence."

### **Music:**
- Uplifting, building (solution state)

---

## 🎬 SCENE 4: THE IMPACT (1:30 - 2:00)

### **Visual:**
- Montage of 3 quick scenes:

**Scene A (5 sec):** Practitioner showing patient the data
- Text: "Patient Transparency"

**Scene B (5 sec):** Network map showing connections between clinics
- Text: "Network Effects"

**Scene C (5 sec):** Graph showing data accumulation over time
- Text: "Research Acceleration"

### **Text Overlay:**
```
The Vision:

Turn every clinical encounter
into a research contribution

Accelerate field advancement by 10-20 years
```

### **Voiceover:**
> "This isn't just a tool. It's the infrastructure the field desperately needs. Every treatment becomes a research contribution. What took Dr. Fadiman 17 years, we can do in 17 months."

### **Music:**
- Inspirational, building to climax

---

## 🎬 SCENE 5: WHY NO PHI (1:45 - 2:00)

### **Visual:**
- Simple comparison table fades in

### **Text Overlay:**
```
Why No PHI?

With PHI:                    Without PHI:
❌ $500K/year compliance    ✅ $0 compliance cost
❌ $10.8M breach risk       ✅ Zero breach risk
❌ Cross-site sharing blocked ✅ Network benchmarking enabled
❌ Competing with Epic      ✅ Blue ocean (no competitors)
```

### **Voiceover:**
> "And here's the strategic insight: benchmarking doesn't need patient identifiers. Removing PHI removes 90% of our risk and enables the one thing competitors can't do: real-time cross-site data sharing."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 6: CALL TO ACTION (2:00 - 2:30)

### **Visual:**
- Fade to clean screen with logo
- Contact information appears

### **Text Overlay:**
