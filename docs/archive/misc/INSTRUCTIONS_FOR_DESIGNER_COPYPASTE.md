**DESIGNER,**

You have been granted **TEMPORARY CREATIVE FREEDOM** for landing page concept exploration.

**Read this document immediately:**
`DESIGNER_TEMPORARY_CREATIVE_FREEDOM.md`

**Your Mission:**
Create 3 world-class landing page concept proposals inspired by:
- Webflow homepage
- Google "Antigravity" homepage  
- https://metoro.io
- https://missioncontrol.co

**Temperature:** 9.5 (maximum creativity)

**Key Rules:**
1. ✅ Work in isolated branches ONLY (`landing-concept-1`, `landing-concept-2`, `landing-concept-3`)
2. ❌ NEVER touch `main` or `dbase-rebuild` branches
3. ✅ Create concept proposals (markdown) FIRST
4. ✅ Build prototypes ONLY if I approve concepts
5. ✅ Report to LEAD when concepts ready

**Deliverable:**
3 concept documents, each with:
- The Concept (high-level vibe)
- The Blueprint (detailed component flow)
- Inspiration Reference (similar website link)
- Key Innovations (what makes it special)
- Technical Feasibility (complexity assessment)
- Estimated Timeline (how long to build)

**Theme:**
"A journey into the Portal. At each stop, they find a treasure (one of our components) that gives them insight, structure, information, sharing, clarity, privacy."

**Transformations:**
- Fragmented → Cohesive
- Analog → Digital
- Isolated → Connected
- Blurred/Uncertain → Crystal Clear
- Lost in the Dark → Enlightened

**Creative Freedom:**
Explore geometry, physics, depth, materiality, negative space, typography, motion, interactivity. Think "Awwwards Site of the Day."

**Constraints:**
Must remain HIGHLY professional, yet appealing to progressive, leading-edge audience.

**Timeline:**
- Tonight/Tomorrow AM: Concept proposals
- Present to me when ready
- Prototypes only if approved

**Acknowledge receipt and begin.**

**That's it! Just copy-paste the above to DESIGNER and they'll have everything they need.** 🚀
