---

### **Phase 2: SAFETY INTELLIGENCE ENHANCEMENTS** 
**Timeline:** Mar-Apr 2026 (8 weeks)  
**Focus:** Deepen safety moat, add AI-powered risk detection

#### **Enhancement 1: Advanced Drug Interaction Engine**
**Current State:** Basic interaction checker  
**Enhancement:**
- **Multi-drug synergy analysis** (3+ drug combinations)
- **Dosage-dependent risk scoring** (25mg psilocybin vs 40mg)
- **Patient-specific risk factors** (age, weight, liver function)
- **Temporal risk windows** ("Don't dose within 2 weeks of MAOI")
- **Pharmacokinetic modeling** (half-life, clearance, CYP450 interactions)

**Technical Approach:**
- Expand `ref_knowledge_graph` with CYP450 enzyme data
- Add dosage thresholds to interaction rules
- Implement Bayesian risk scoring algorithm
- Add patient physiology risk modifiers

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Catches risks no other system can detect

**Effort:** 4 weeks  
**Value:** Deepest drug interaction system in psychedelic therapy

---

#### **Enhancement 2: Real-Time Vital Signs Monitoring Integration**
**Current State:** Manual entry of vitals  
**Enhancement:**
- **Bluetooth vital signs integration** (BP monitors, pulse oximeters, ECG)
- **Automated alert thresholds** (BP >180/110 = immediate alert)
- **Trend analysis during session** (detect declining SpO2)
- **Post-session vital report** (export for EHR/legal)

**Safety Use Cases:**
- **Cardiac risk:** Detect hypertensive crisis during session
- **Respiratory depression:** Alert if SpO2 drops below 92%
- **Autonomic instability:** Flag rapid HR variability

**Technical Approach:**
- Bluetooth integration with consumer medical devices
- Real-time data streaming to safety dashboard
- Alert triggers based on clinical thresholds
- Export to PDF for documentation

**Impact:** 🔴 **MASSIVE** - First psychedelic platform with real-time physiological monitoring

**Effort:** 4 weeks  
**Value:** Prevents adverse events DURING sessions, not just after

---

#### **Enhancement 3: Predictive Safety AI**
**Current State:** Reactive (flag known risks)  
**Enhancement:**
- **Machine learning risk prediction** (predict adverse events before they occur)
- **Pattern recognition across network** (identify risk patterns)
- **Personalized risk scoring** (patient-specific safety profile)
- **Explainable AI recommendations** (show WHY risk is high)

**Example AI Outputs:**
> "⚠️ **HIGH RISK PREDICTION (87% confidence)**  
> Patient profile (45yo, HTN, Sertraline 100mg) + Psilocybin 30mg has 23% adverse event rate in network data.  
> Recommendation: Reduce dose to 20mg or discontinue Sertraline 2 weeks prior."

**Technical Approach:**
- Train ML model on `log_clinical_records` + `log_safety_events`
- Feature engineering: age, weight, medications, dosage, indication
- Logistic regression for adverse event prediction
- LIME/SHAP for explainability

**Impact:** 🔴 **REVOLUTIONARY** - No competitor has predictive safety AI

**Effort:** 6 weeks  
**Value:** Shift from reactive safety to PREDICTIVE safety

---

### **Phase 3: COMPLIANCE AUTOMATION**
**Timeline:** May-Jun 2026 (8 weeks)  
**Focus:** Reduce compliance burden, automate documentation

#### **Enhancement 4: Dynamic Informed Consent Engine**
**Current State:** Static consent forms  
**Enhancement:**
- **Risk-adaptive consent** (auto-generates consent based on patient risk factors)
- **Ontological risk disclosure** (spiritual/existential risks)
- **Touch consent for iPad** (patient signs on device)
- **Multilingual support** (Spanish, Portuguese for Oregon/Colorado)
- **Version control** (track consent form changes over time)

**Example:**
> Patient: 45yo, HTN, SSRI  
> Consent auto-includes:  
> - Cardiovascular risk disclosure (HTN + psychedelic)
> - Reduced efficacy disclosure (SSRI interaction)
> - Serotonin syndrome warning (SSRI + psilocybin)
> - Ontological risk (worldview shifts)

**Technical Approach:**
- Rules engine that queries patient risk factors
- Dynamic PDF generation with risk-specific disclosures
- E-signature integration (DocuSign-style)
- Legal audit trail

**Impact:** 🔴 **HIGH** - Defensible, patient-specific consent

**Effort:** 4 weeks  
**Value:** Reduces legal liability, automates compliance

---

#### **Enhancement 5: Automated Regulatory Compliance Tracker**

- **Automated compliance scoring** (% of requirements met)
- **Renewal reminders** (license expiration, training requirements)
- **Regulatory change alerts** (when laws update)
- **Audit-ready export** (generate compliance report for state boards)

**Example:**
> **Oregon Compliance Dashboard:**  
> ✅ Measure 109 Training: Current (expires 2027-03-15)  
> ✅ Facilitator License: Active  
> ⚠️ Client Assessment Logs: 89% complete (10% missing)  
> ✅ Safety Protocols: Documented  
> 
> **Compliance Score: 94%** (Target: 100%)  
> **Next Action:** Complete 11 missing assessment logs

**Technical Approach:**
- Database of state regulations (Oregon, Colorado, etc.)
- Rules engine to check practitioner compliance
- Automated alerts for renewals/expirations
- Export to PDF for state audits

**Impact:** 🔴 **HIGH** - Prevents license revocation, saves hours of manual tracking

**Effort:** 4 weeks  
**Value:** Only platform with state-specific compliance automation

---

### **Phase 4: SAFETY NETWORK INTELLIGENCE**
**Timeline:** Jul-Aug 2026 (6 weeks)  
**Focus:** Network-wide safety insights, early warning system

#### **Enhancement 6: Network-Wide Safety Alert System**
**Current State:** Site-specific safety tracking  
**Enhancement:**
- **Real-time network safety alerts** (if 3+ sites report same issue, alert whole network)
- **Early warning system** (detect emerging safety patterns)
- **Substance-specific risk profiles** (update as network data grows)
- **Safety bulletin distribution** (monthly safety newsletter)

**Example:**
> **NETWORK SAFETY ALERT (2026-03-12)**  
> ⚠️ Emerging Pattern Detected:  
> 5 sites reported respiratory depression with Psilocybin + Gabapentin combination in past 14 days.  
> Recommendation: Avoid this combination until further investigation.  
> [View Detailed Report]

**Technical Approach:**
- Network-wide `log_safety_events` monitoring
- Pattern detection algorithm (clustering similar events)
- Automated alert triggers (N≥3 similar events)
- Email/SMS notification system

**Impact:** 🔴 **MASSIVE** - First network-level early warning system in psychedelic therapy

**Effort:** 3 weeks  
**Value:** Prevents adverse events across entire network

---

#### **Enhancement 7: Safety Benchmarking 2.0**

**Enhancement:**
- **Risk-adjusted safety scores** (control for patient complexity)
- **Safety percentile ranking** ("You're in 85th percentile for safety")
- **Safety improvement tracking** (month-over-month safety trends)
- **Best-practice recommendations** (learn from safest sites)

**Example:**
> **Your Clinic Safety Score: 92/100** (85th percentile)  
> Network Average: 87/100  
> 
> **Strengths:**  
> ✅ Zero serious adverse events (vs network avg 2.3%)  
> ✅ 100% vital signs monitoring compliance  
> 
> **Opportunities:**  
> ⚠️ Pre-session screening completion: 89% (vs 96% at top sites)  
> **Recommendation:** Implement automated screening reminders

**Technical Approach:**
- Risk-adjustment model (control for patient age, comorbidities)
- Percentile ranking algorithm
- Trend analysis (time-series safety metrics)
- Best-practice extraction from high-performing sites

**Impact:** 🔴 **HIGH** - Gamifies safety, drives continuous improvement

**Effort:** 3 weeks  
**Value:** Creates culture of safety excellence
