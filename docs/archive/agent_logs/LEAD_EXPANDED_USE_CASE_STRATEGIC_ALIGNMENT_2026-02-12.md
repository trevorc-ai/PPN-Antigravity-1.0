**Current Problem:**
- Protocol Builder is **60% complete** (desktop version functional, mobile needs optimization)
- NO automated measurement-based care (practitioners manually enter outcomes)
- NO billing/reimbursement guidance

**VoC Reality Check:**
> "Coverage remains limited and inconsistent. Immense confusion around CPT codes."

**Recommendation:** 🟡 **REFINE & COMPLETE**
1. Finish Protocol Builder Phase 1 mobile optimization (Est: 1 week)
2. Add CPT code guidance layer (Est: 2 weeks)
3. Build Automated MBC MVP (Est: 4 weeks)

---

### **Tier 3: WORKFLOW INTEGRATION** (Missing - 25%)

| Use Case | Status | VoC Demand | Competitive Advantage | ROI Estimate |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **UC-7: End the Software Patchwork** | 🔴 MISSING | #1 Pain Point | vs. Fragmented tools: Single platform | 5-10 hours/week saved |
| **UC-8: Log 6-8 Hour Sessions Efficiently** | 🔴 MISSING | Critical Need | vs. Generic EHRs: PAT-specific | Replaces Excel/manual tracking |
| **UC-9: Standardize Protocols Across Team** | 🔴 MISSING | Group Practice Need | vs. Inconsistent care: Protocol wiki | Reduced training time |

**VoC Quote:**
> "A typical practitioner describes a workflow that is a patchwork of disconnected tools: IntakeQ for forms, Spruce for secure messaging, Spotify for music, Excel for tracking outcomes, and a generic EHR like SimplePractice for billing."

**Current State:**
- ❌ No session logger for real-time event tracking during 6-8 hour sessions
- ❌ No protocol wiki for standardized, community-maintained best practices
- ❌ No group therapy cohort management
- ❌ Practitioners still using 4-5 disparate tools

**Competitive Context:**
- **Osmind:** EHR-focused, NOT session-specific logger
- **SimplePractice:** Generic therapy EHR, NOT PAT-specific
- **IntakeQ:** Forms only, NOT practice OS

**Recommendation:** 🔴 **BUILD IMMEDIATELY** - This is THE #1 switching reason

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Session Logger MVP** (6 weeks)
   - Tap-to-log events during session
   - Real-time vitals tracking (BP, HR, SpO2)
   - Integration with Protocol Builder
   - Export to EHR (CSV/PDF)

2. **Protocol Wiki MVP** (4 weeks)
   - Community-maintained protocol library
   - Expert-vetted best practices
   - Searchable by substance, indication, dosage
   - Version control

3. **Group Therapy Management** (6 weeks)
   - Cohort scheduling
   - Group protocol templates
   - Shared outcome tracking

**Total Effort:** 16 weeks (Q2 2026)  
**Impact:** 🔴 **MASSIVE** - Addresses #1 VoC pain point, 3x TAM expansion

---

### **Tier 4: COMMUNITY & NETWORK** (Missing - 12.5%)

| Use Case | Status | VoC Demand | Network Effects | Retention Impact |
|----------|--------|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **UC-10: Find Peer Supervision** | 🔴 MISSING | #2 Pain Point | Dyad/Circle matching | High stickiness |
| **UC-11: Access Mentorship** | 🔴 MISSING | Transition Support | Elder directory | Career development |
| **UC-12: Learn from Network Data** | 🟡 PARTIAL | Benchmarking exists | Community insights | Knowledge sharing |

**VoC Quote:**
> "The transition from 'trainee' to 'practitioner' is described as a perilous cliff. Once in practice, clinicians feel isolated. The unique challenges of PAT—such as intense counter-transference, spiritual emergencies, or erotic transference in altered states—require specialized supervision that is hard to find."

**Current State:**
- ✅ Network benchmarking (existing feature)
- ❌ No supervision exchange
- ❌ No mentorship matching
- ❌ No peer support forums
- ❌ Practitioners experience "lone wolf burnout"

**Network Effects Opportunity:**
- **Supervision Exchange:** Dyad matching (complementary skills), Circle system (6-8 cohorts), Elder directory (20+ years)
- **Community Features:** Case discussion forums, peer consultation scheduling
- **Mentorship:** Clear pathways from trainee → practitioner → supervisor → elder

**Recommendation:** 🔴 **BUILD FOR V1.5** - Creates defensible moat through network effects

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Supervision Exchange MVP** (8 weeks)
   - Practitioner profiles (skills, experience, availability)
   - Matching algorithm (complementary skills)
   - Scheduling integration
   - Verification system (credentials check)

2. **Mentorship Platform** (6 weeks)
   - Elder directory
   - Mentorship request system

### **Tier 5: INTEGRATION & OUTCOMES** (Missing - 15%)

| Use Case | Status | VoC Demand | Revenue Impact | Client Retention |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **UC-13: Standardize Integration Protocols** | 🔴 MISSING | #3 Pain Point | Integration revenue stream | Reduced client churn |
| **UC-14: Track Neuroplasticity Window** | 🔴 MISSING | Clinical Need | Better outcomes = referrals | 6-week engagement |
| **UC-15: Measure Integration Success** | 🔴 MISSING | Outcomes Data | IES/EIS tracking | Sustained remission |

**VoC Quote:**
> "Integration is the most common 'bridge concept' between practitioner intent and client outcomes. It is described as necessary, but also expensive and time-consuming. There is a lack of structured tools to keep clients engaged between sessions."

**Current State:**
- ❌ No integration protocol templates
- ❌ No homework assignment tools
- ❌ No neuroplasticity window tracking (0-6 weeks post-session)
- ❌ High client churn due to lack of structure

**Business Impact:**
- **Client Churn:** Current industry avg ~40%, could reduce to ~25% with structured integration
- **Revenue:** Integration sessions = recurring revenue stream
- **Outcomes:** Better integration = sustained remission = referrals

**Recommendation:** 🔴 **BUILD FOR V2.0** - Addresses "what happens after the session" gap

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Integration Hub MVP** (8 weeks)
   - Structured integration protocols (before/during/after)
   - Homework assignment tools
   - Neuroplasticity window tracking
   - Integration measurement (IES/EIS)

2. **Client Engagement** (4 weeks)
   - Automated check-ins (no PHI - practitioner-administered)
   - Progress tracking
   - Integration milestone tracking

**Total Effort:** 12 weeks (Q3 2026)  
**Impact:** 🔴 **HIGH** - 30% reduction in client churn, new revenue stream

5. Network effects create **defensible moat**

**Risk of NOT Pivoting:**
- ❌ Low practitioner adoption (product doesn't solve real pain points)
- ❌ High churn (20%+ monthly)
- ❌ Weak competitive position (commoditized documentation tool)
- ❌ Limited TAM (5,000 practitioners vs. 15,000)

**Confidence Level:** 🔴 **VERY HIGH (95%)**

---

### **Decision 2: MESSAGING UPDATE TIMING**

**Question:** Update hero message and value props immediately or wait for Phase 2 features?

**Current Hero:**
> "Global Psychedelic Practitioner Network"  
> (Subheadline about Practice Operating System)

**VoC-Aligned Hero Options:**

**Option A - ASPIRATIONAL (Update Now):**
> "The Practice Operating System for Psychedelic Therapy"  
> "End workflow chaos. Find peer support. Prove outcomes."

**Option B - CURRENT STATE (Wait for Phase 2):**
> "Defensible Documentation + Clinical Intelligence for Psychedelic Therapy"  
> "Benchmark safety. Track outcomes. Reduce malpractice exposure."

**LEAD Recommendation:** 🟡 **HYBRID APPROACH**

**Immediate (This Week):**
- Update subheadline to reference "Practice Operating System" vision ✅ DONE
