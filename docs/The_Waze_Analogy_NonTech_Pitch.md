# The "Waze" Analogy: How to Explain PPN to Non-Techies

**Audience:** Family, friends, non-technical partners, and casual conversations.
**Goal:** Eliminate all jargon (no "Zero-PHI", no "SaMD", no "Relational DBs"). Focus entirely on *the human problem* and *the simple solution*.

### The 30-Second Elevator Pitch (The Waze Analogy)

"You know how the Waze app works, right? When you hit a traffic jam or a pothole, your phone quietly sends that data up to the cloud. Because millions of cars are doing that at the same time, the app knows exactly where the traffic is and routes everyone else around it. 

Right now, psychedelic therapy is blowing up because people are desperate for mental health solutions. But the therapists are flying blind. They are using pen and paper. If someone has a bad reaction, or if a specific treatment works incredibly well, the therapist next door has no way of knowing. 

I built **Waze for psychedelic therapy.** 

When a therapist uses my software to track a session, the system strips away the patient's name and identity entirely, but keeps the results. We pool all those results together. So now, if a therapist is about to mix a specific psychedelic with a patient's heart medication, my software throws up a red flag and says, *'Stop, this is dangerous.'* Or it says, *'Hey, for severe depression, this specific dose has an 80% success rate across the country.'* 

I'm stopping therapists from flying blind and making sure every patient session makes the whole network safer for the next person."

### Handling the Follow-Up Questions (Without Jargon)

#### 1. "Wait, isn't it illegal?"
*The Non-Tech Answer:* "It depends on the state and the substance. Ketamine is totally legal everywhere. Other things like Psilocybin (mushrooms) are legal in places like Oregon and Colorado, and the FDA is reviewing others right now. Millions of people are doing this either way. My software doesn't provide the medicine; it just provides the safety guardrails because people need them *today*."

#### 2. "What if hackers steal the medical records?"
*The Non-Tech Answer:* "That's the best part. They can't. When a doctor uses my software, they never type in the patient's name. They only type in a secret code number. The doctor keeps the master key locked in their office cabinet. If a hacker broke into my servers tomorrow, all they would find is a giant spreadsheet of math and random numbers. They couldn't tie a single result back to a real human being."

#### 3. "Are you like WebMD or an Electronic Health Record (EHR)?"
*The Non-Tech Answer:* "Not really. Electronic Health Records are basically digital filing cabinets. They're built for billing insurance. My software is an *intelligence* tool. It's built to actually look at the data and help the therapist make a safer, better decision in real-time."

#### 4. "How do you make money?"
*The Non-Tech Answer:* "It's a subscription model. Clinics and practitioners pay a monthly fee to use the software to run their business smoothly and protect themselves from making a dangerous medical mistake."

### The 3 Golden Rules for Talking to Family

1. **Never use acronyms.** (PHI, HIPAA, NNT, SaMD, API). They stop listening instantly.
2. **Focus on Safety.** Everyone understands "preventing a bad drug interaction." That is a universally understood value proposition. 
3. **Use the Waze metric.** "Every session makes the next session safer." This perfectly explains the "network effect" without sounding like a Silicon Valley bro.
