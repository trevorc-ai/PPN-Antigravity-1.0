Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy (PAT) is **transformational and longitudinal**. It is an "Arc of Care" that spans weeks or months, involving altered states of consciousness, intense emotional vulnerability, and a critical "integration" window where the actual healing happens.

The current medical infrastructure (EHRs like Epic or Cerner) is built for transactions, not arcs. This creates massive data blind spots.

Here is the breakdown of the complexities, nuances, and pain points across the three phases of the PAT journey.

### **Phase 1: Preparation (The "Set & Setting" Variable)**

*The Baseline Problem: Inconsistent Inputs*

Before a single milligram is administered, the success of the therapy is heavily influenced by "Set" (mindset) and "Setting" (environment). Standard medical records have no fields for this.

* **Complexity:** Capturing "Expectancy Bias." A patient who *believes* the treatment will work is statistically more likely to improve. If we don't measure their baseline hope/fear levels, we corrupt the efficacy data.  
* **Nuance:** **Medication Tapering.** Many patients are on SSRIs (antidepressants) which blunt the effects of psilocybin/MDMA. Tracking the *exact* tapering schedule and wash-out period is critical, yet often relies on patient self-reporting, which is notoriously unreliable.  
* **Pain Point:** **The "Screening Bottleneck."** Clinicians spend hours manually vetting patients for contraindications (e.g., family history of psychosis/schizophrenia). One missed detail in a PDF form can lead to a severe adverse event.  
* **Data Gap:** Most clinics capture "Medical History" but fail to capture "Psycho-Spiritual History" (previous trauma, meditation experience), which are massive predictors of resilience during a difficult trip.

### **Phase 2: The Dosing Session (The "Black Box")**

*The Monitoring Problem: The Ineffable Experience*

This is the 4–8 hour period where the drug is active. In a standard clinical trial, this is the main event. In real-world practice, it is a data black box.

* **Complexity:** **Subjective vs. Objective Reality.**  
  * *Objective:* Blood pressure spikes, heart rate variability (HRV), dissociation levels.  
  * *Subjective:* "I met God," "I relived my childhood trauma," "I felt infinite grief."  
  * *The Challenge:* How do you map a spike in Heart Rate (Time: 2:00 PM) to a specific subjective insight? Without time-stamped correlation, the biometric data is just noise.  
* **Nuance:** **The "Observer Effect."** You cannot ask a patient "How do you feel?" every 15 minutes without ruining the therapeutic immersion. Data collection must be passive (wearables) or retrospective.  
* **Pain Point:** **Manual Note-Taking.** Therapists are busy "holding space" (providing safety). They cannot be typing on a laptop. As a result, critical safety data (e.g., "Patient needed 20mg Propranolol at hour 3") is often written on paper scraps and entered into the EHR days later, losing accuracy.  
* **The "Batch" Variable:** In underground or gray-market settings, the potency of the substance (e.g., 3g of *Psilocybe Cubensis*) varies wildly. "3 grams" is a meaningless data point without knowing the psilocybin/psilocin content.

### **Phase 3: Integration (The "Data Desert")**

*The Tracking Problem: The Drop-Off*

This is the weeks/months following the dose where the patient tries to incorporate the experience into their life. This is where the "Cure" actually happens—or fails.

* **Complexity:** **The "Afterglow" False Positive.** Patients often report feeling "cured" or euphoric for 1–2 weeks post-dose (the Afterglow). Real efficacy is measured at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Most data tracking stops at Week 2 because the patient stops coming to the clinic.  
* **Nuance:** **Behavioral Change vs. Symptom Reduction.**  
  * Standard EHRs track *Symptoms* (PHQ-9 score: "Are you less sad?").  
  * PAT aims for *Behavioral Change* ("Did you reconnect with your estranged father? Did you quit smoking?").  
  * Current tools fail to capture these "Quality of Life" metrics, which are often the true indicators of success.  
* **Pain Point:** **The "Integration Gap."** Patients leave the clinic and return to their toxic environments. If they spiral, the clinic often doesn't know until the patient relapses or attempts suicide. There is no real-time "remote monitoring" to flag a patient who is destabilizing 3 weeks post-treatment.

### **The Analysis Nightmare: Trying to Find the Signal**

When you try to aggregate this messy data to prove "This Works" to insurance companies or the FDA, you run into the **"Interoperability Wall."**

1. **Siloed Data:**  
   * Pre-screening data is in a PDF/Typeform.  
   * Dosing notes are on paper or a rigid EHR.  
   * Integration journals are in the patient’s head or a separate app.  
   * Wearable data (Apple Watch) is trapped in Apple Health.  
   * *Result:* You cannot run a query like: *"Show me all patients with high baseline anxiety who had a difficult trip but successful long-term outcomes."*  
2. **Lack of Standardization (The "Tower of Babel"):**  
   * Clinic A records "Dose: High."  
   * Clinic B records "Dose: 25mg."  
   * Clinic C records "Dose: 3 grams."  
   * *Result:* You cannot compare outcomes across clinics. This prevents the industry from learning "Best Practices."

### **Summary of the Opportunity for PPN**

The pain isn't just "too much paperwork." The pain is that **valuable clinical wisdom is evaporating** because the tools (EHRs) act like buckets with holes.

* **The Clinic's Pain:** They can't prove their value to insurers because they lack longitudinal outcome data.  
* **The Patient's Pain:** They feel supported during the dose but abandoned during integration (The "Supervision Desert").  
* **The Industry's Pain:** We are repeating the same mistakes (adverse events) because we aren't sharing safety data in a standardized format.

**Our Strategy is to solve this by:**

1. **Standardizing the Input:** (The "Clinic OS" forces a common language).  
2. **Bridging the Gap:** (The "Patient App" captures the Integration phase).  
3. **Unlocking the Black Box:** (The "Crisis Logger" captures the session safety data).

To fully capture the "Arc of Care" in Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy (PAT), we must move beyond simple "medical records" and build a **Longitudinal Data Engine**. This engine ingests standardized inputs at every stage and outputs actionable intelligence.  
Here is the blueprint of **What to Measure**, **How to Measure It**, and **Why It Matters**.

### **1\. The Data Dictionary: What We Must Collect**

We break the data collection into three distinct buckets matching the patient journey.

#### **Phase 1: The Baseline (Pre-Dosing)**

*Goal: Establish the starting point and predict resilience.*

| Data Point | Standard Metric / Scale | Why It Matters (The Insight) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Depression Severity** | **PHQ-9** (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) | The "Gold Standard" for insurance reimbursement. Scores \>10 indicate clinically significant depression. |
| **Anxiety Severity** | **GAD-7** (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) | High baseline anxiety often predicts a "challenging experience" (bad trip). |
| **Trauma History** | **ACE Score** (Adverse Childhood Exp.) | High ACE scores correlate with lower resilience. Knowing this allows the guide to increase support. |
| \*\* PTSD Symptoms\*\* | **PCL-5** (PTSD Checklist) | Specific tracking for trauma flashbacks and avoidance behaviors. |
| **"Set" (Mindset)** | **Expectancy Scale** (1-100) | "Placebo Effect" tracking. High belief \= High efficacy. Low belief \= Resistance. |
| **Physiology** | Resting HRV & Blood Pressure | Safety baseline. Can their heart handle the acute stress of the medicine? |

#### **Phase 2: The Experience (Acute Dosing)**

*Goal: Monitor safety and quantify the "ineffable."*

| Data Point | Standard Metric / Scale | Why It Matters (The Insight) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Substance Depth** | **MEQ-30** (Mystical Experience Quest.) | The \#1 predictor of long-term success. A "Complete Mystical Experience" correlates with 80% remission rates. |
| **Ego Dissolution** | **EDI** (Ego Dissolution Inventory) | Measures "breakthrough" potential. Did they dissociate enough to rewire neural pathways? |
| **Challenging Nature** | **CEQ** (Challenging Experience Quest.) | Measures fear, grief, and physical distress. High CEQ isn't "bad," but it requires more integration support. |
| **Safety Events** | **MedDRA Codes** (Adverse Events) | Standardized coding for "Nausea," "Panic Attack," "Hypertension." Essential for FDA reporting. |
| **Interventions** | **Rescue Protocol Logs** | Did the guide use "Verbal De-escalation" or "Chemical Rescue" (Benzos)? This measures guide efficacy. |

#### **Phase 3: The Integration (Longitudinal)**

*Goal: Track retention of benefits and catch relapse early.*

| Data Point | Standard Metric / Scale | Why It Matters (The Insight) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Symptom Decay** | **Repeated PHQ-9** (Days 1, 7, 14, 30\) | Visualizes the "Afterglow." We want to see the curve flatten, not spike back up. |
| **Quality of Life** | **WHOQOL-BREF** | Are they just "less sad" (symptom reduction), or are they living better (social connection, work)? |
| **Sleep Quality** | **PSQI** (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) | Sleep is the first thing to break before a mental health relapse. It is the "Canary in the Coal Mine." |
| **Suicidality** | **C-SSRS** (Columbia Scale) | Mandatory safety check. Any spike here triggers an immediate "Red Alert" to the clinician. |

### **2\. The Analytical Engine: Turning Data into "Super-Powers"**

Collecting data is useless unless it changes behavior. Here is how PPN analyzes this stream to upgrade both the Patient and the Provider.

#### **A. For the Patient: " The Mirror" (Self-Knowledge)**

* **The Feedback Loop:** instead of just filling out forms, the patient sees their own data visualized.  
* **The Insight:** *"Hey John, we noticed that your anxiety (GAD-7) drops by 40% on weeks where you log at least 3 'Nature Walks' in your integration journal."*  
* **The Benefit:** It gamifies their recovery. They stop being a passive recipient of a drug and become an active participant in their healing.  
* **Visual:**

#### **B. For the Provider: "The Dashboard" (Clinical Intelligence)**

* **The Feedback Loop:** The provider sees aggregated trends across their entire patient population.  
* **The Insight:** *"Dr. Smith, your patients have a 15% higher relapse rate at Week 4 compared to the Global Average. Analysis shows you are under-dosing the second session."*  
* **The Benefit:** It turns a solo practitioner into a "Data-Informed Clinician." They can benchmark their success rates against the industry standard.  
* **Visual:**

#### **C. For the Administrator/Insurer: "The Proof" (Value-Based Care)**

* **The Feedback Loop:** proving that the therapy saves money in the long run.  
* **The Insight:** *"This cohort of 50 patients had a 60% reduction in emergency room visits for suicidality in the 6 months following treatment."*  
* **The Benefit:** This is the "Golden Ticket" for insurance coverage (CPT Code 0820T). Insurers pay for *outcomes*, not just *hours*.

### **3\. Critical Implementation Nuance: "The Pulse Check"**

The biggest pain point is **Survey Fatigue**. Patients hate filling out long forms (PHQ-9 has 9 questions, GAD-7 has 7).  
**The PPN Solution: "Micro-Checkins"**

* Instead of a weekly 50-question survey, send a daily **1-tap pulse check** via SMS/App:  
  * *"On a scale of 1-5, how connected do you feel today?"*  
  * *"How did you sleep last night?"*  
* **The Algorithm:** If the "Pulse" drops below a threshold (e.g., 2 days of "Low Connection"), *then* trigger the full PHQ-9 to dig deeper. This keeps compliance high and data clean.

### **Summary**

By standardizing these inputs (using **LOINC** and **SNOMED** standards), PPN moves the industry from "Shamanic Art" to "Precision Medicine."

* **We don't just ask "Did it work?"**  
* **We answer:** *"It worked for this specific phenotype (High ACE, Low HRV) using this specific protocol (30mg Psilocybin \+ 4 Integration Sessions)."*
