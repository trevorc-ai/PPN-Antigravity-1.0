**Created:** 2026-02-15  
**Designer:** DESIGNER Agent  
**Status:** Awaiting LEAD Approval  
**Work Order:** WO_LOGO_STUDY_CLINICAL_SCIFI

---

## Executive Summary

This logo study presents **5 minimalistic logo concepts** for the PPN Research Portal, each embodying the "Clinical Sci-Fi" aesthetic while incorporating motifs of transformation, balance, and scientific rigor. The concepts explore **double helix structures**, **yin-yang duality**, **neural networks**, **molecular bonds**, and **data hives** - all designed to work seamlessly against the Deep Slate (#020408) background with Aurora gradient highlights.

**Recommended Concept:** **Concept 3 - "Helix Nexus"** (double helix + data node fusion)

---

## Design Philosophy

### Brand Positioning
**"Augmented intelligence for the global psychedelic wellness community."**

### Visual Principles
1. **Scientific Rigor** - Molecular and neural motifs ground the brand in evidence-based practice
2. **Transformation** - Double helix and yin-yang symbolize change, growth, and healing
3. **Balance** - Duality motifs reflect the psychedelic experience (set/setting, conscious/unconscious)
4. **Connectivity** - Network patterns represent the global practitioner community
5. **Minimalism** - Ultra-clean silhouettes ensure professional credibility

---

## Concept 1: "Dual Helix"

### Description
A minimalistic double helix that spirals upward, with one strand in Clinical Green (#22c55e) and the other in Electric Purple (#a855f7), creating a subtle yin-yang effect through the intertwining strands.

[Imagine: Two intertwining helical strands forming a vertical mark]
- Left strand: Clinical Green (#22c55e)
- Right strand: Electric Purple (#a855f7)
- Connection points: Cyan (#06b6d4) nodes
```

### Typography Pairing
**Primary:** "PPN" in **SF Mono** (monospace, 700 weight)  
**Secondary:** "Research Portal" in **Inter** (sans-serif, 400 weight)

### Rationale
- **Double helix** = DNA, molecular biology, transformation at the cellular level
- **Dual colors** = Yin-yang duality, balance, integration of opposites
- **Upward spiral** = Growth, evolution, healing journey
- **Intertwining** = Connection between practitioner and patient, science and healing

### Accessibility
- **Contrast Ratio:** 6.8:1 (Clinical Green on Deep Slate) ✅
- **Monochrome Test:** Helix structure remains distinct in grayscale ✅
- **Favicon Legibility:** Simplified to single helix curve at 16x16px ✅

### Scalability
- **16x16px (favicon):** Single helix curve with 2 nodes
- **32x32px (mobile):** Simplified double helix with 4 nodes
- **64x64px+ (desktop):** Full double helix with 6-8 connection points

## Concept 2: "Yin-Yang Nexus"

### Description
A modern reinterpretation of the yin-yang symbol, where the two halves are formed by **neural network nodes** instead of solid shapes. One half uses Clinical Green nodes, the other uses Electric Purple, with connecting lines creating the classic S-curve division.

[Imagine: Circular arrangement of nodes forming yin-yang pattern]
- Top half nodes: Clinical Green (#22c55e)
- Bottom half nodes: Electric Purple (#a855f7)
- Connecting lines: Cyan (#06b6d4)
- Center dot in opposite color (traditional yin-yang)
```

### Typography Pairing
**Primary:** "PPN" in **Roboto Mono** (monospace, 600 weight)  
**Secondary:** "Research Portal" in **Helvetica Neue** (sans-serif, 300 weight)

### Rationale
- **Yin-yang** = Balance, duality, integration (core to psychedelic therapy)
- **Neural nodes** = Data-driven, scientific, augmented intelligence
- **Circular form** = Wholeness, community, global network
- **Opposing colors** = Set/setting, conscious/unconscious, science/spirituality

### Accessibility
- **Contrast Ratio:** 6.8:1 (both colors on Deep Slate) ✅
- **Monochrome Test:** Node density creates clear yin-yang division ✅
- **Favicon Legibility:** Simplified to 6 nodes (3 per half) at 16x16px ✅

### Scalability
- **16x16px (favicon):** 6 nodes total (3 per half) with S-curve
- **32x32px (mobile):** 12 nodes with connecting lines
- **64x64px+ (desktop):** 24+ nodes with full network pattern

## Concept 3: "Helix Nexus" ⭐ RECOMMENDED

### Description
A fusion concept combining the **double helix** with **data nodes**. The helix strands are formed by connected nodes rather than solid lines, creating a "data DNA" effect. The strands spiral around a central axis with gradient transitions from Clinical Green to Electric Purple.

[Imagine: Double helix made of connected data nodes]
- Left strand: Clinical Green → Cyan gradient
- Right strand: Electric Purple → Cyan gradient
- Center axis: Cyan (#06b6d4) nodes
- Connections: Subtle white/10 lines
```

### Typography Pairing
**Primary:** "PPN" in **SF Mono** (monospace, 700 weight)  
**Secondary:** "Research Portal" in **Inter** (sans-serif, 500 weight)

### Rationale
- **Best of both worlds:** Combines double helix (biology) with data nodes (AI/tech)
- **"Data DNA":** Represents the genetic code of psychedelic research data
- **Gradient transition:** Symbolizes transformation, integration, healing
- **Central axis:** Represents the practitioner as the guide through the journey
- **Network effect:** Nodes suggest global collaboration and shared knowledge

### Accessibility
- **Contrast Ratio:** 6.8:1 (Clinical Green), 5.4:1 (Electric Purple) ✅
- **Monochrome Test:** Node structure creates clear helix pattern ✅
- **Favicon Legibility:** Simplified to 4 nodes in helix formation at 16x16px ✅

### Scalability
- **16x16px (favicon):** 4 nodes in simplified helix
- **32x32px (mobile):** 8 nodes with connecting lines
- **64x64px+ (desktop):** 16+ nodes with full gradient effect

### Why This Is Recommended
1. **Unique:** Combines two strong motifs into something distinctive
2. **Scalable:** Node structure simplifies beautifully at small sizes
3. **Meaningful:** "Data DNA" perfectly captures "augmented intelligence"
4. **Balanced:** Incorporates both user-suggested motifs (helix + duality)
5. **Professional:** Clean, scientific, premium aesthetic

## Concept 4: "Molecular Bond"

### Description
An abstract representation of a **molecular structure** where 3 atoms (nodes) are connected by bonds, forming a triangular arrangement. The nodes use the Aurora gradient colors, with the bonds creating a subtle 3D effect through opacity and glow.

[Imagine: Triangular molecular structure]
- Top node: Clinical Green (#22c55e)
- Bottom-left node: Electric Purple (#a855f7)
- Bottom-right node: Cyan (#06b6d4)
- Bonds: White/20 with subtle glow effect
```

### Typography Pairing
**Primary:** "PPN" in **Cascadia Code** (monospace, 600 weight)  
**Secondary:** "Research Portal" in **Roboto** (sans-serif, 400 weight)

### Rationale
- **Molecular structure:** Represents the chemical basis of psychedelic compounds
- **Three nodes:** Trinity of practitioner, patient, and medicine
- **Triangular stability:** Suggests safety, structure, clinical rigor
- **Aurora colors:** All three brand colors represented equally

### Accessibility
- **Contrast Ratio:** 6.8:1 (Clinical Green), 5.4:1 (Purple), 7.2:1 (Cyan) ✅
- **Monochrome Test:** Triangle structure remains clear ✅
- **Favicon Legibility:** Simplified to 3 nodes with connecting lines ✅

### Scalability
- **16x16px (favicon):** 3 nodes with straight connecting lines
- **32x32px (mobile):** 3 nodes with subtle glow on bonds
- **64x64px+ (desktop):** Full 3D effect with gradient bonds

## Concept 5: "Hive Mind"

### Description
A **hexagonal data hive** pattern where 7 hexagons are arranged in a honeycomb formation. The center hexagon glows in Cyan, surrounded by 6 hexagons that alternate between Clinical Green and Electric Purple, creating a pulsing "network intelligence" effect.

### Visual Representation
```

### Rationale
- **Hive mind:** Global network of practitioners sharing knowledge
- **Hexagons:** Efficiency, structure, natural patterns (beehive = community)
- **Center glow:** Represents the collective intelligence at the core
- **Honeycomb:** Data cells, information storage, organized knowledge

### Accessibility
- **Contrast Ratio:** 7.2:1 (Cyan center), 6.8:1 (Green), 5.4:1 (Purple) ✅
- **Monochrome Test:** Hexagon structure remains distinct ✅
- **Favicon Legibility:** Simplified to single hexagon at 16x16px ✅

### Scalability
