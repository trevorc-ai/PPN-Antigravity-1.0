# 🎯 TRIPPINGLY PARTNERSHIP: STRATEGIC ADVISOR PROPOSAL
## Partnership + Advisory + Investment Opportunity

**For:** Trippingly.net founder (Former VC)  
**From:** Trevor Calton, PPN Portal  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Opportunity:** Affiliate partnership + strategic advisor + potential angel investment

---

## 💡 THE STRATEGIC PLAY

### **Why This Is Interesting (VC Lens):**

**Market Opportunity:**
- Psychedelic therapy market: $10.75B by 2027 (68% CAGR)
- Ketamine clinics: 500+ in US, growing 30%/year
- Oregon psilocybin: 14 licensed sites, 100+ in pipeline
- Colorado: Natural medicine legalization (2024)

**The Problem:**
- Practitioners have no safety benchmarking tool
- Osmind (competitor) collects PHI → can't do cross-site benchmarking
- Regulatory scrutiny (DEA, state boards) demands documentation

**PPN's Moat:**
- No PHI architecture → enables network benchmarking
- Competitors can't copy without abandoning PHI
- Network effects: More practitioners → better benchmarks → more value

**Traction:**
- Beta: 14 sites, 10,247 protocols logged
- Pricing: $49-$499/month (SaaS)
- Target: $1M ARR by Month 12

- Earns 20% recurring commission on referrals
- Projected: $1,500-$45,000/month passive income

**Why:**
- Monetizes existing audience (10K-50K monthly visitors)

**Details:** See TRIPPINGLY_PARTNERSHIP_PROPOSAL.md

---

### **Part 2: Strategic Advisor (Equity)**

- **0.5-1.0% equity** (advisor shares, 4-year vest)
- Or: **$5K/month cash** (if prefers cash)
- Or: **Hybrid:** 0.25% equity + $2.5K/month

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- Former VC = fundraising expertise (PPN will raise Seed round)
- Trippingly network = psychedelic industry connections
- Growth marketing expertise (Trippingly scaled to 50K visitors)

**What PPN Needs Help With:**
1. **Fundraising:** Seed round ($500K-$1M) in Q2 2026
2. **Go-to-Market:** Practitioner acquisition strategy
3. **Partnerships:** MAPS, Multidisciplinary Association, Numinus
4. **Growth:** Viral loops, referral programs, network effects

**Potential Return:**
- Exit scenario: $50M-$100M (acquisition by Osmind, Epic, or PE)

- At $50M exit → $625K return (12.5x)

## 📧 PITCH EMAIL (DRAFT)

**Subject:** Partnership + Advisor Opportunity (PPN Portal)

Hey [Name],

Quick context: I'm building **PPN Portal**, a clinical intelligence platform for psychedelic practitioners (ketamine clinics, psilocybin facilitators, etc.).

**The opportunity:** Practitioners need safety benchmarking, but competitors (Osmind) collect PHI → can't do cross-site benchmarking. We don't collect PHI → we can. That's our moat.

**Traction:** 14 sites, 10,247 protocols logged. Targeting $1M ARR by Month 12.

**Three-part proposal for you:**

1. **Affiliate partnership:** Trippingly adds "Find a Practitioner" directory, earns 20% recurring commission. Projected: $1,500-$45,000/month passive income.

2. **Strategic advisor:** Join as advisor (fundraising, go-to-market, partnerships). Compensation: 0.5-1.0% equity or $5K/month cash.

3. **Angel investment (optional):** Invest $25K-$100K in Seed round (Q2 2026). Potential 12.5x-25x return at exit.

**Why this makes sense:**
- You know psychedelic market (Trippingly)
- You know fundraising (former VC)
- You know growth (scaled Trippingly to 50K visitors)
- Aligned incentives (affiliate + advisor + investor)

**Next step:** 30-min call to discuss? I'll walk you through the business model, traction, and how you can help.

Let me know if you're interested.

Best,  
Trevor
